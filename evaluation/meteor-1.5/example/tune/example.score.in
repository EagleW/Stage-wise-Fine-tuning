SCORE ||| as such , the experts debated , for instance , when the saurians split into the three most important lines of development : the carnivorous theropods , which later included tyrannosaurus rex , the velociraptor and birds , the four-legged sauropods known as the " long necks " and their relatives , and the plant-eating ornithischiae ( bird-hipped saurians ) , which included , for instance , the triceratops and stegosaurus species . ||| experts wonder to what time the sauriens were divided into three groups of major developments : the théropodes ) finger ( , which includes the tyrannosaure and the vélociraptor emerged and which are the birds , the sauropodes , quadrupedal animals in the long neck , and those who are related and the herbivores ornithischiens including species such as the triceratops and the stégosaure .
SCORE ||| according the analysis of nesbitt and his colleagues , tawa hallae is a primal theropod . ||| according to studies of nesbitt and his colleagues , the tawa is one of the first théropodes .

SCORE ||| as the related line of the huge sauropods later also had air bags and lightweight bones , the joint ancestor of these two groups will probably have come up with this useful innovation . ||| as the related line of immense sauropodes had also air bags and a slight , their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation .
SCORE ||| at least three migration waves to north america ||| three successive waves of migration to north america .
SCORE ||| as the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in south america , the scientists come to the conclusion that the saurians appeared there first . ||| as dinosaurs the most primitive known lived in south america , researchers have concluded that the sauriens had occurred there .
SCORE ||| accordingly , the three lines of development separated early on and spread from south america across all parts of the planet , which still formed a single land mass as the super continent pangaea . ||| therefore , the three main lines of evolution was divided and was from south america to the rest of the world is to say all the land which formed the supercontinent pangée .
SCORE ||| this theory is backed up by the fact that the team found two more theropods which are not particularly closely related along with the remains of tawa hallae . ||| that appears to be confirmed by the fact that the team paléontologues has also discovered the remains of two other théropodes which are not related .
