<seg id="1"> A duel in the blade of the knife: MP3 players against the mobile. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Advice on how to choose </seg>
<seg id="3"> While nearly every cell phone can play MP3 files, any MP3 Player can call. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It seems clear that it is better to buy a phone. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Yet there are plenty of reasons to have a man took a stand-alone player. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> It entirely depends on The use and the claims of the future of the owner. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Probably hard to take home a top expensive record player to listen to the latest album Maxim Turbulenc. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Both these musical products On the one hand, for the LP to plates and not a qualitative point of view for even there is no objective reason. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Need if it in your rack vinyl with art rock, jazz or blues, probably on a turntable at least to eat. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It's the same with music on the move, is the music, so the music in MP3. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And there are price and quality categories. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For someone may be unacceptable to spend on player eight thousand crown, as well as the fan Pink Floyd to zkousne headphones for twenty crown from the market. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Two extremes, between which is not enough space for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The choice is wide. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> It shall act and the resilience of batteries </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Some top music player can cope with much more than just play music, but what most handset or by accident. </seg>
<seg id="17"> No current device is not as universal as the telephone. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition to the primary functions, telephone and esemeskování, can play music and video, both record, has the better, the worse the camera and be able to navigate well. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And when we take into account the smartphone and communicators, you will have in my pocket and a small computer. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is a small miracle, you can not grill, no refrigerator, no TV and no nevyfotografuje. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The universality of mobile phone offers and disadvantages. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The more functions to the mobile phone use, the sooner you send to nabíječce indicator on display. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And the music is one of the biggest glutton energy. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Few mobile phone can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most of it is much less. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In this regard, the music player (especially the simplest) significantly more powerful. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> In the case of cheap mobile therefore expect that for more than a few hours you will play. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If you still want to call it every now and then you get there, you work for security in yet another charger-to pay for more expensive equipment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In the case of MP3 players will not have this problem, even the worst lasts at least 9 hours of continuous operation on one charge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Another problem occurs when recording music to mobile phones. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Unfortunately, only a limited part of the apparatus has a universal plug USB, and not all of them can be directly connected to your computer without special software. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Of course, you can record music directly to a memory card, but Few card reader, without a reduction in order to miniature memory cards, which are used in Mobile. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> In the case of the players to the exceptions (iPod) , no special software required. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Just fill the music from your computer via USB. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Most handset and the players can no longer create its own music library already sorted itself by a the name, the title of the album, the genre or the evaluation of the user. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Some devices display of only tree directories like the Explorer in Windows, and some they can do both (iRIVER, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phone operating system) . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Players are easier to handle, mobile phones more skilled </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> In the selection of a particular device interest in particular on the endurance, memory capacity of quality and type of audio output, and, of course, as well as comfort and control. </seg>
<seg id="38"> If you mainly background music and if you listen to it every day just to be in the short tram, you just to any cell phone that plays MP3. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Which can no longer really almost any mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It's Do not have too much to see what the cell phone or music player formats can. </seg>
<seg id="41"> MP3 to deal with all of them, and the vast majority of music that you will receive will be in this format. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Is one of the most widespread and apart from the overwhelming majority of devices can handle the music in WMA. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The Less the AAC format used by Apple and its iPods) . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Better mobile phones also allow, for example, the purchase of online music. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Just visit the Internet via mobile operator of the site (or another) and a song or album you buy. </seg>
<seg id="46"> This service would no longer itself could be a compelling argument for the acquisition of mobile music. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Unfortunately, the operators offer is low and is limited mostly to rychlokvašené radio hits. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Prices Also are low. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Generally, however, that it is this way of selling music (either via GSM, Internet or wireless internet) into the future opanuje music industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> Most people carry a cell phone with you. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Whenever you want something you listen to, a cell phone in the pocket nahmatáte, while the MP3 player is left at home. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Still, however, depends on whether or not it also always wear headsets or hands-free wire. </seg>
<seg id="53"> If not, you can take the integrated speaker, which is almost every mobile phone, but only a minimum of MP3 players. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Probably the biggest benefit of music mobile will be for many of the price. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The cheapest is normally under three thousand. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> For the three and four thousand crowns already take a very decent Walkman. </seg>
<seg id="57"> But mostly you will restrict output in the absence of the normal to the headphones. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The best and after the technical aspect of nejvybavenější phones with 3.5 mm normal headphone jack and for standing up to 15, 000. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> Advantage of players, inter alia, The easy operation. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The simplest-not necessarily the cheapest (see our choice)-players can handle any real control. </seg>
<seg id="61"> The Minimum functions, similar to the control with previously normal cassette recorder or the record player is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="62"> There is a conflict in the form of mistake is on the mobile Internet and the giant account for data transmission. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> After which the device works </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64"> Even the cheapest mobile (such as Vodafone 527) are a slot on the removable memory card (the type of M2, microSD, etc. ). </seg>
<seg id="65"> Even with dokoupením of the cards to come into the two thousand. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Take care, however. </seg>
<seg id="67"> The basic models are supported only card with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Only the most expensive can cope with 8 GB paměťovkami. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The first virtual operator arrive in the Czech Republic already this year. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Perhaps it </seg>
<seg id="3"> The Mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in the Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Yet here we are missing something-the virtual operator, which forced the classic cheap. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Perhaps not miss a long time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The fact that the Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we ever Mobil.cz wrote it very much. </seg>
<seg id="7"> After all, said confirmed to the who pointed out that the price of the SMS is with us more than in the rest of the Union. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the last steps of the European Commission's on the regulation of roaming charges and perhaps there is a paradoxical situation-for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are held in Europe so far? </seg>
<seg id="10"> The answer is simple, the lack of competition, which would really like to go to war. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Maybe it sounds paradoxically, we have a three mobile telephony and high penetration of over 100% . </seg>
<seg id="12"> Mobile operators on the contrary, like rails, the Czech market is extremely competitive. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In that they often says and the President of the Council of the Czech telecommunications office (CTO) Pavel Dvorak, who in the past on several occasions that the next operator in the Czech Republic is the place. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is probably true that the typical operator with its own networks, it too seems to have chances (is after all, I would probably be hard to find the frequency) . </seg>
<seg id="15"> But there is one more possibility-a virtual operator. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> On The entry of virtual operators in the mobile market has brought a significant reduction in prices, which then had to respond and traditional operators. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Yet In doing so, even before the entry into force as of Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile on the market heard in the UK as a similar vote in our country. </seg>
<seg id="18"> But it turned out that the place for such operators and can be really successful. </seg>
<seg id="19"> After all, we need for the examples do not go too far. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In February of this year, we let you know about the start Mobilking virtual operator in Poland. </seg>
<seg id="21"> For half a year, the authorising this year to more than 100,000 customers and become its fifth largest operator. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In doing so, for Mobilkingem is a financial group Penta, which owns in the Czech Republic, inter alia, for: fona. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Virtual operators The Advantage of is the ability to focus on a specific age group. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In order to function effectively, they simply had far fewer customers than classical operator. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Entail a relatively high cost of the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In a world with the virtual operators usually profile as a low-cost-offering cheap calls and SMS, which but this is often offset by the supply of services. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> So be Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors. </seg>
<seg id="28"> However, as shown by the example of Mobilkingu in Poland, it may be quite a good bet to pull even neotřelou audience. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The operator has focused specifically on the men. </seg>
<seg id="30"> " administrative guys elect Mobilking-operator, which they like and which can trust, " says CEO David Seibertz Mobile entertainment Company, operating in this virtual operator. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It is hard to say whether it would be similar to the concept as in Poland, and for us. </seg>
<seg id="32"> A spokesman for doubt Miroslav Čepický: " Czech market is The relatively small segment of the approach on which most virtual operators is based. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Moreover, it is In terms of the supply of services is relatively saturated. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In the Czech Republic, without a chance to say mobile operators </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But it seems almost certain that, in the Czech Republic as a virtual mobile operator will, it Mobilking. </seg>
<seg id="36"> " The expansion of this successful project we speak, in the Czech Republic but negotiations look too promising. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Rather, it will start Mobilkingu in other countries of our region, " she said in a telephone interview Mobil.cz John Studničková, spokesperson financial group Penta. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Indirectly confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic, strongly supportive of this idea are not. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Quite On the contrary, it is trying to do everything possible so that any potential competitor emerged. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Interest in the launch of the virtual mobile operator is no longer a group GTS neta Novera, which would like to make a further step to become a real competitor Telefóniky O2 in the field of corporate customers. </seg>
<seg id="41"> " we have a great interest in what we can offer our customers to but not only fixed and mobile telecommunications services. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And the sooner the better. </seg>
<seg id="43"> This we have repeatedly discussed the possibility of all Czech with mobile operators. </seg>
<seg id="44"> With some of them, we have succeeded in negotiations forward, " says a spokesperson Paul kaidl group. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Thus, glittering for better times. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The unofficial information, it appears that the first virtual operator may have to wait until the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="47"> In the meantime, but the emergence of accompanying the impenetrable wall of silence. </seg>
<seg id="48"> " At the moment I do not think that this is on the Czech market space for a full of virtual operator. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The Czech market is compared to other markets are very specific. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Yet So far, we addressed any entity on the with a complex and serious project in this area, " he said in his statement on Mobil.cz Vlastimil hornet from the press department Telefóniky O2. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> The specificity of the Czech market, claiming and other operators. </seg>
<seg id="52"> A spokesman for the T-Mobilu Martin Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the expression of O2: " So far our attention no viable and mutually beneficial commercial project, which would make it possible to build. " </seg>
<seg id="53"> He adds: " And The network of T-Mobile in until the end of the year is a virtual operator. </seg>
<seg id="54"> At this point I would like to have on the table a specific agreement in order to be considered in the short term. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> Vodafone focused their attention more to meet the requirements of its own 3G licenses. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Miroslav Čepický says: " Negotiations with potential virtual operators we are open, especially in the area of cost sharing and the infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Malaysia to consider in terms of customers for most. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Vodafone's main strategies in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile Internet. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The responsible authorities-with one hand </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> The cell phone can easily understand the entry of another operator would mean an increase in the competition, has led to a drop in prices and a decline in their profits. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Why facilitate the emergence of a competitor? </seg>
<seg id="62"> The fact that, when the operators of something, able to pull together, indicating the emergence of a scramble around the U: fona. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Some of the biggest pressure came in the CTO at the time of this U: the fona from T-Mobile. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Suggests that The publicly available information from websites the CTO. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Now, however, the U: fon useful as an argument why it should not be a virtual operator. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Martin Kemrová it said: " the competitive environment of the the mobile market, moreover, has recently been exacerbated by the entry into force of the fourth mobile operator on the market. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Having regard to the nature of the mobile market in the work, it is clear that the entry of other players on him and on his services, placed high demands. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> In view of this the mobile operators but directly striking a total lack of Czech regulatory authorities. </seg>
<seg id="69"> This is only the position of CTO, which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic-unlike the United Kingdom and the other developed countries-does not have the power to intervene in the competition. </seg>
<seg id="70"> They belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (OPC) . </seg>
<seg id="71"> But that the whole issue had his typical position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> " Enter the virtual operator at the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract took place between the mobile operator and a virtual operator leasing the necessary infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="73"> No such contract has not been concluded yet, as most offer potential for classic operators did not sufficiently interesting, " he said in response to our question of the Christian Cottage of the External Relations Department Office. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> From among the representatives of the operators as worded statement about it. </seg>
<seg id="75"> From the office which is to represent the interests of consumers and ensure, among other things, and that no misuse of his position in the market, it is more than disquieting. </seg>
<seg id="76"> Especially when Christopher cottage adds: " Abroad, where the virtual operators routinely, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone service. " </seg>
<seg id="77"> But Perhaps the pressure on the correct operation of the market and the fall in prices does not belong to the interests of OPC. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> The shocking truth, the whole case is only touching the interplay of three mobile operators, which results from their responses. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The question of whether it is really just an accident, offers a completely alone. </seg>
<seg id="80"> As well as exactly the same price of gasoline at service stations is certainly a chance and work hard in competition. </seg>
<seg id="81"> " The office in this matter did not find evidence of anticompetitive behavior, and therefore has no reason to intervene in some way. </seg>
<seg id="82"> None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore, no corresponding increase in responsibility for their actions in the market. </seg>
<seg id="83"> The necessary tools for the opening of the market for mobile virtual operators probably meet for telecommunications and regulators, " he said in his statement Cottage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="84"> Interpretation of a dominant position on the market is one of many of the points. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets prepared CTO, under which telecommunications competition from the perspective of a single market. </seg>
<seg id="86"> On that market, then, of course, none of the Czech operator does not have a dominant position. </seg>
<seg id="87"> But Some legal experts offered a different view-to a virtual operator is always a need for the consent of the network. </seg>
<seg id="88"> A mobile operator-has logically-And on its network a monopoly. </seg>
<seg id="89"> So in a certain segment must necessarily be dominant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90"> But Even if that argument does not permit, the Office should be at least warn that the three mobile operators to remarkably similar. </seg>
<seg id="91"> In doing so, a number of complaints of candidates (including the GTS Novera) show that in the treatment of all operators faced with very similar obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="92"> Outsourcing liability to responsibility for the CTO is then in the Telecommunications relatively normal trick, which gives the Office of the hands off the matter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93"> We met with him in several of similar cases. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Unfortunately, until recently adopted an amendment to the telecommunications law, extension of the powers of the ČTÚ in the area of competition in telecommunications to failed to impose, although from what many experts promised to improve the situation. </seg>
<seg id="95"> To be represented by OPC to know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96"> It really is, when no one is </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="97"> In doing so, without identifying the remains of a pseudovirtuálních operators, which in the Czech mobile networks are just a few. </seg>
<seg id="98"> These are the companies issuing their own price lists of mobile telephone services, which are public but only partially. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Usually, the companies involved in the multilevel marketing. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Its own mobile telephony services to be offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife, and many others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="101"> Price lists of these firms are usually go only to a chosen. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Charm lies in the fact that the company against the operator acts as a standard business customer who purchases a large number of SIM cards. </seg>
<seg id="103"> As a major customer will receive special and the price (and other) . </seg>
<seg id="104"> The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators like přeprodej prohibited. </seg>
<seg id="105"> " If there are cases in which you talk, it could be a breach of the terms of the contract, which we were and could result in termination of the close cooperation with the company, " she said to our query on this issue for Kemrová Martin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="106"> But it is unlikely that the similar activity to the responsible people from the cell phone. </seg>
<seg id="107"> In particular, in the case of the three companies may be a thousand customers. </seg>
<seg id="108"> None of the operators shall not prevent such a procedure. </seg>
<seg id="109"> The activities of these companies have had significant gains while-unlike the real virtual operators-they do not pose a threat to its own official marketing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="110"> Highlights Of the possible problems Miroslav Čepický: " The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies only a negligible percentage of customers. </seg>
<seg id="111"> In addition, you must accept that the SIM card in the phone is not led by their name, it can not therefore have full as ordinary customers of mobile operators. " </seg>
<seg id="112"> This should nevertheless CTO at least strange. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="113"> Moreover, opens another question for OPC. </seg>
<seg id="114"> If the mobile operators přivírají over a similar procedure eyes, why not block in the creation of a virtual operator? </seg>
<seg id="115"> That said, the OPC is to detect similar activity relatively strong powers, and unless we want to, it may not be satisfied with an explanation of the operators that do not have anything that idea, and their business conditions to prohibit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="116"> When we will not be the most </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117"> As it has in the text several times, the entry of virtual operators in the mobile market brought zaznamenatelný fall in prices for services. </seg>
<seg id="118"> At the same time, In virtually all countries, where the virtual operator is, they tried to traditional operators of the emergence of their more or less. </seg>
<seg id="119"> They used arguments were virtually identical-too small, or too saturated market, problems with the quality of the service, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="120"> In developed countries, but in those moments hit regulatory authorities to protect not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Whether formal or informal Measures of the pressure, then that it was the first virtual operator and nabalovali the others. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities throughout the case reverses like a hot potato. </seg>
<seg id="123"> From our experience, we can escape the impression that not ambiguity in their competence in these cases, more than suitable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="124"> But throw in Flint the rye. </seg>
<seg id="125"> If the background information correct and virtual operator with us are really coming soon, the Czech mobile market may be set in motion again. </seg>
<seg id="126"> If any of the operators the creation of a virtual mobile operator said, hard to be able to remain indifferent to the Office rejection (discrimination) of other candidates. </seg>
<seg id="127"> And we need to call cost more than in the rest of Europe. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Well, that the policy of the word " relatively " and in his claim to the fact that the German banking sector will be a crisis of development spared. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Because he is the last weekend. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Dax index of financial reference house specializing in the real estate financing of Hypo Real Estate (HRE) gets from a consortium of German banks, credit in the amount of several billion to protect against protection the turbulence in the markets. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A person familiar with the situation on Monday told Reuters that the credit will support up to 35 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Interest will have to hypo Real Estate (HRE) to pay only the amount actually spent. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The money would come from the private and public banks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the background are the loss of a subsidiary Depfa. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The state financier, according to newspaper reports on long-term projects, which lent the money, extremely short term to refinance which is now due to lack of confidence in the markets is not possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the first half of 2008, the Reserve Bank has dwindled to 95% of to 2.37 million euro and fell slightly and the proportion of equity from 1.6 to 1.45 percent. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Ordinary income and net income revenue from financial transactions, compared to last year fell to zero, from increased value of the claims and of certain securities as well as the cancellation of provisions for credit trading fell by more than 70 percent of the 5 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But thanks to higher proceeds from the settlement of compensation for the subsequent costs of the restructuring of the former group Depfa, and of the interest tax in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and the brokering the group of companies was šestnáctiprocentní fall on the more moderate income. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Former state financier, after its privatization in 1990, burned to mortgages for the professions, which have been allocated from the portfolio of services and also led Aareal Bank. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Because in the conventional state funding is earn too little, engaged with the Depfa heavily in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects by private investors and the State (Public-Private-Partnership, the PPP) and is internationally diversified. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The value of its subsidiary companies must now Hypo Real Estate and something to write off, the depreciation will have " tangible effect on the calculation of the profit and loss of the group, as some left to hear. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The fact is that the dividend. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Already for 2007 was reduced by two thirds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Hypo Real Estate is from the Depfa major financier state and infrastructure projects. </seg>
<seg id="20"> More than other institutions depends on the refinancing of the interbank market, because no customer deposits. </seg>
<seg id="21"> After the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago virtually dry spring of interbank loans, as banks keep liquidity. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Hypo Real Estate needs a year for the part of the loan portfolio Depfa-about $50 billion-short-term funds to refinance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> According to The Commission of Hypo Real Estate, the financial need is for a group of the credit for this dohlednou period covered and the company is protected " from the influence of the international money markets are largely incapable. " </seg>
<seg id="24"> Other sources are to hear that the money is to ensure that the refinancing by the end of 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The President of HRE Georg funke, on the other hand, he said that the group of hypo Real Estate group in the foreseeable future will not have to use the money markets. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The Federal Bank and the National Institute for the supervision of financial services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the group hypo Real Estate market is now assured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> In the hope that shareholders and creditors of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But with regard to the dynamism and nepostižitelnost crisis is likely there is certainty. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Even it is not completely out of the question that the loan was to be completely exhausted. </seg>
<seg id="30"> However, excluded or otherwise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> After the Bank on Sunday, too late in the afternoon, seems to have stood before can not, though preliminary, rescue calm the passions. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The rate of shares fell 75 percent to 3.30 euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> On the contrary, as well as rates bonds. </seg>
<seg id="34"> While priority debts are practically applied, the rates of secondary bonds lose more. </seg>
<seg id="35"> This concerns mainly the bond of former subsidiary company Württemberg Hypo and logically bonds with maturities beyond 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Bonds Hypo-Real-Estate originally appeared as an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability is necessary for a significant tightening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the Institute itself, which the company brought it to the acquisition of Depfa, understood in relation to the stability of the international financial system. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> As long as the issue of the Bank, governments and less affected by commercial banks would be willing to support the system, it is possible to anticipate the payment of securities in their maturity. </seg>
<seg id="38"> But It may also be the case in what is now almost no one dares to hope-not in the next 15 months will be overcome the financial crisis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> However, given the reports coming at the same time, with this partial nationalization of the likelihood of bordering with certainty now became only legitimate hope. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Especially the long-term creditors are prepared by a number of probdělých nights when deciding whether to waive their obligations. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The rats have feelings of </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> When a rat or a cockroach before escaping danger, it means that also feel scared? </seg>
<seg id="3"> Neurologist Joseph Ledoux is convinced that many animals have feelings. </seg>
<seg id="4"> But how it would be possible to verify whether the feel the same when they behave like us? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the internet magazine " edge " is already for several years published the well-known scientists. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Spiegel online in the series introduces answer to the question " What is the truth, without needing to be able to prove it? " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> I believe that the animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without I or anyone else ever could prove it if we can prove that the knowledge to other people. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But in this case, at least we can hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But as soon as we start to pay a different type of other and open a question of perception, or a general sense, we are entering the field in because the hardware is, does not. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> When the rat is in danger, he would do the same, as many other animals: it will pretend to dead, flee or attack. </seg>
<seg id="11"> People behave similarly, which some scientists to conclude similar subjective perception. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In this, however, I do not believe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Two aspects of brain structures impede the transfer of our subjective experience of the perception of the animals. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is partly because of the associated with human knowledge almost always include the side prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in the short term memory and execution and management) . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> This vast area is for humans developed significantly more than other primates, and it seems that in the case of other creatures for missing. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At least those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them learning who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that the man is even from other primates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Another dramatic specificity could hide the nature of the man: it is a large part of his perceptions associated with language, often says that the consciousness of depends on it. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In this case, we could be the animals. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But even if the language knowledge of the matter, it would certainly influence the language, so the animal consciousness, whether it is designed, however, are likely to differ from most of our states of consciousness. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Therefore, it is difficult to see how it looks knowledge for other animals. </seg>
<seg id="21"> When, as something of the internal and subjective, can not be measured or, because of the specific hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, put us of his examination of the major problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Most of my connection is related to the content of the conscious experience, but in addition, there is another aspect of consciousness, which should be scientifically easily accessible. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It would be possible to processes in the consciousness of the animals to examined, irrespective of their content, and this is exactly what is happening in the studies of short-term memory in primates, especially the example of visualization. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But this approach, which is devoted Christof Koch and Francis Crick, will focus more on the neural correlates of consciousness, rather than causal mechanisms: both can be identical, but they are not. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of nefrontálního for the implementation of the visual cortex. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> What this means for the feelings? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I concludes that the emotional system as a system of fear, is activated in the brain of his own activities. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What we call " fear ", it is the mental state in which we are, when defense system activity localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reaction) will make use of the RAM. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Seen from this angle, the feelings are closely linked with those areas of the cortex, which are primates, and especially the people. </seg>
<seg id="30"> In connection with the linguistic nature of The creates a fine graduation, because by using words and grammar can distinguish and categorize conditions, we are beside themselves attributed the second. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> By contrast, for example, Antonio Damasio considers that the feelings arising from the simpler activity in the areas of the brain stem cortex and devoted to personal feelings, like Jaak Pankseep, but more focus on the brain stem. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Because of this network, in the course of human evolution, too, could still contribute to feelings perceived several animal families. </seg>

<seg id="34"> Pankseep argues that what we in rats and humans appear to be afraid, is likely to have both organisms as well: How is it possible to verify but says further Pankseep that rats and people feel the same, when they behave similarly? </seg>
<seg id="35"> Cockroach against the risk of flee-he also felt fear? </seg>
<seg id="36"> From my point of view, not only the similarity of behavior to prove conformity of experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> It is true that a comparison of neural moves us away: rats and humans have similar brain cells, by contrast, cockroaches or the brain. </seg>
<seg id="38"> But it is responsible for feelings of the brain stem? </seg>
<seg id="39"> And even if it is possible to demonstrate in humans: how we wanted to demonstrate in rats? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> I believe that the rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows? ), have feelings. </seg>
<seg id="41"> But I really don't know how I do it. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And because of their feelings are likely to be substantially different from those of our (the human consciousness is based on specific constituencies and language) examine the emotional behavior rather than emotional the perception of rats. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> Indeed, in this case, we can see progress on the neural level, as in the case of the rats, and we will measure the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As in rats examined the language and consciousness, or examine the feelings, after all, ' I don't know whether there are. </seg>
<seg id="45"> It is possible to consider a short-sighted, but rather is moving forward on than to have it against the wall. </seg>

<seg id="7"> That with such performance differences fight, promotes Obama's education agenda in particular, among other things, " transitional bilingual education " for those who are still learning English. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Barack Obama on the issue, however, remains whether his commitment to bilingvnímu training, which emphasizes that class to used in languages other than English, is stronger than his interest in reducing the performance gap. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, charter elementary school in the district of East Los Angeles. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Students of the schools are in most cases of Hispanics from low-income families. </seg>
<seg id="11"> More than a third of students, many of which came only recently, are still learning English. </seg>
<seg id="12"> And yet, in the state test scores of mathematics in 2008 reached the highest level of at an astounding 100 percent of the fourth of the pupils. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Almost as wonderful ninety-three percent of fourth grades students received at the highest level in the state were the test of English language and Literature. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This incredible success has been achieved by any other method, which prefers Obama. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Sixth Street underscores the control and training, the assessment of the capabilities of and access without excuses. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In addition, and that Obama would be noted by Linda Mikelsové, Director of Sixth Street, a pedagogical approach to school for those who are still learning English, " full immersion ". </seg>
<seg id="17"> Immersion in English emphasizes almost the sole use of the English language in the teaching. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Miss Mikelsová, which is against bilingual education, she said to me: " We had a great success with a completely new pupil in Mexico-after twelve months, you went to class and not who he is. " </seg>
<seg id="19"> " it works, " she said, " for us it works. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Obama would take the school as a Sixth Street Prep as a model, as how it should look like other schools with large shares of the Hispanic and English, the training of pupils? </seg>
<seg id="21"> The results, which the school, should be part of the answer to this question is taken for granted, but the educational agenda of his own party (national education association is a longtime supporter of bilingual education) and his consistent support for bilingual education znejasňují predicting Obama's response. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> While Obama has agreed that immigrants should learn English, trivialized the case recently when he declared that people should not worry about the " English only " laws. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Instead, " you should ensure that your children speak Spanish, " he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> If Obama really wants to delete the performance differences should be rather educational models that work, to think carefully before they mock and trivialize it. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Eatonville, the first completely black city that was incorporated into the state and where the Zora Neale Hurstonová spent his childhood, is no longer so simple as described in 1935, " The city of five lakes, three kroketových pitches, three hundred brown skin, three hundred good sailors, enough guavas, two schools and no prison. " </seg>
<seg id="4"> Now It is the site. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual festival eatonvillský Zora! To take the bow Hurstonové, most famous women's writer the Harlem Renaissance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The city, which described, the party, although it did stop for tourists that it included in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers Project at the time of economic crisis. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is still so independent, dignified and private, as it was in the 1930s, when Hurstonová wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resist and share their actual feelings with white man, who " we know so little that she did not know what it is. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Even now, in the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for open debate on Race, an many of the residents remain cautious about their foreign. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> " We provide great care to how to tell our story, " says 59letá Hortense Jones, who lived since birth and is a member of the parish in the city. </seg>
<seg id="10"> " It must be right. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Eatonville has long been described as the paradox of triumph and effort. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is both a historical model of a black the rise, so the community almost 2400 people, where poverty rates are twice the from the national average. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Is the literature, but also the center of oaks shaded example of Southern rural black culture-sometimes, sometimes acclaimed-has been launched from American slavery. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is Not too surprising that local people are both proud and ochranářští. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And worried about the idea of Eatonvillu really began to Zorou, which is the only way we are here Hurstonové says. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Introduced the world through their hometown a book full of warm dialect as " Mules and Men (mules and men) " (1935) and " their eyes Were Watching God (their eyes follow God) " (1937) . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Five paragraphs Florida tourist guide to the city has changed little in 17 road that leads through the center of Florida is often brushed aside, the stage in black history and human drama. </seg>
<seg id="18"> With razancí large drum in the life and literature Hurstonová introduced readers to trade the first eatonvillského Mayor Joe Clark, and then turned into personalized sites. </seg>
<seg id="19"> " left by the road, " she wrote, " is brown-white decorated with a modern school with well-maintained yards and the golf course, which is always the old Howard Miller, even courts can not read or write. " </seg>

<seg id="20"> It Also mentioned a new husband and widows Dashové wrote that Lee Glenn " sells drinks of all kinds, and anything at all that fits into the hourly hotel. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> So in just a few hundreds of words link Hurstonová Eatonville, the Palestinian Authority, but also with illiteracy, znovuuzavíraním marriage and sex. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This is clearly not a typical publisher Fodor's. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In fact, it was a portrait that would all appreciate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> " Zora said it, as it was, " says devadesátiletá Ella Dinkinsová, one of the Johnson girls choir, which Hurstonová made immortal by quoting a man who sang about the beauty of their stupid songs. </seg>
<seg id="25"> " Some people didn't like that, " she added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Hurstonovou The to be here still recalls as a nimble výstřednici, which often back after her family moved to Florida Jacksonville. </seg>

<seg id="30"> But, he added, houpaje the chair on the back terrace with a view of the lake Sabelia where Hurstonová most likely to be baptized, " never was too long. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> When Hurstonová 1960 died were poor and the books have been withdrawn from the press. </seg>
<seg id="32"> It seemed to her Eatonville, together with the rest of the world had forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although once a literary star, contemporaries Langston Hughes and the only black at Barnard College in the 1920s of the 20th century, was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce Florida, where he lived. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> There were no more In Eatonvillu mourning ceremony or large public reading. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> " At that time, a group of white boys, they come and throw oranges and things to the people who were sitting on the side, " said Franklin. </seg>
<seg id="43"> " Actually, we had one lady, which it killed. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Throwing from the car melon. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> In a letter to the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, challenged the requirement Hurstonová Supreme Court on the forced integration and of its decision in the case of Brown against the chamber for the training, said that " for my rather than celebrating. " </seg>
<seg id="46"> People now says that The desegregation of schools, although in some areas was positive, reducing the Eatonvillu of cohesion and undermined in the courage of the youth. </seg>

<seg id="49"> " round his white teacher because your white teacher-I want to say that there is a cultural barrier, " said Miss Nathiriová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> Civil rights, however, helped to create the space for many other Zory Neale Hurstonové-a black writers, actors and artists who, as she advanced to the prejudices lehkomyslným confidence and quotes such as " How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence! </seg>
<seg id="51"> I never. " </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> HEMA-Québec yesterday celebrated the tenth anniversary of the establishment and its president, dr. Francine Décaryová is rightly rejoiced because HEMA-Québec has become one of the most reliable and efficient suppliers of blood in the world. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Especially you again gained the confidence of the public, which was after the scandal with contaminated blood in the 1980's and 1990's badly shaken. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As is well known, the State Department maintained a reserve of blood transfusion the Canadian Red Cross during the 80th years contaminated immune deficiency virus (HIV) virus and hepatitis C. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In view of this drama and a wave of indignation the public the Canadian government in February 1994 public subject to any form of inquiry, and the judge Horace Krever, and in order to explain the circumstances that led to this tragedy, and to formulate recommendations for such a disaster will not recur. </seg>
<seg id="6"> While the judge Krever hesitated to when the report, some of the province into operation Committee, whose purpose was to plan a new system of the administration of the blood in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In this role Quebec behalf Gélineaův Committee. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After Gélineauově and Kreverově report were in Canada, the establishment of two suppliers: HEMA-Québec, who had managed Québec, and a Canadian company for blood supply of all the provinces and both territories. </seg>
<seg id="9"> " When in 1998 HEMA-Québec launched its activities, 38% of people have more confidence in Quebec the blood system, " says Dr. Décaryová. </seg>
<seg id="10"> " The situation was dismal. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Systematic efforts to enhance the safety of blood products and continuing work in this area during the subsequent years, we once again have to gain the confidence of the public, " he says proudly and adds that at the beginning of 2008 HEMA-Quebec confidence has nearly 94% of Quebec population. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Dr. Décaryová, however, does not lose sight of that confidence is something very fragile. " </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since its inception 28 September 1998 HEMA-Québec apply the precautionary principle. </seg>
<seg id="14"> " When we were in Europe are seeing the emergence of many cases of the human form of mad cow Disease, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, " said the woman, who led the company since its foundation in 1998. </seg>
<seg id="15"> " and we knew that the disease may spread by blood. </seg>
<seg id="16"> We are therefore based on one of the basic recommendations Kreverovy and Gélineauovy reports, according to which, in the case where we don't know, and when it is at stake and spread of serious diseases, in this case, when the disease which is characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, the Negative measures to be taken. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In April 1999, we have therefore rejected the blood of people who abstain from 1980 in the UK for longer than one month. </seg>
<seg id="18"> A few years ago, was safely demonstrated that the disease is transmitted by blood. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This episode has shown us, therefore, that adhere to the principle of caution should make sense. " </seg>
<seg id="20"> In 1999, the market appeared much more accurate technique to detect the HIV Tests with the use of nucleic acid (NAT) , which make it possible to detect in the blood donor directly to the presence of the virus, and not the presence of antibodies, which were based on tests used before. </seg>
<seg id="21"> NAT assays allow the deaf to shorten the period that occurs between the moment the patient's infection and the time when our techniques can be detected in the blood of the first viruses, explains the specialist. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This period can be reduced to less than a week. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors could be infected without knowledge and without to be able to come. </seg>
<seg id="24"> These improvements to significantly reduce the risk of getting HIV/AIDS through blood transfusions. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The risk that he will receive blood contaminated with HIV, is now exposed to a man from 12 million. </seg>
<seg id="26"> " In other words, it means that than someone infected with HIV, will be distributed 12 million blood products. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Whereas HEMA-Québec distributed annually 400 000 to 500 000 blood products, will be 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission through blood products. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I believe that we can get the rest in full or prescribe a a blood transfusion of blood necessary for healing, " says the head of the nation's leadership </seg>
<seg id="29"> " the challenge for us in the next decade is the safety of our products. </seg>
<seg id="30"> We Never know what can be element may appear in the system. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Just last year on the island of Reunion discovered the Chikungunya virus, which is similar to the West Nile virus is transmitted by the blood of insect bites. </seg>
<seg id="32"> It is important to be cautious, " says Dr. Décaryová and stresses that, in addition to the secure supply must HEMA-Québec also count on an adequate supply. </seg>
<seg id="33"> " Needs to grow, because the population ages. </seg>
<seg id="34"> As a result of treatment agresivnějšího cancer patients often need a new batch of red blood cells and platelets. </seg>
<seg id="35"> An aging population also has implications for the network of blood donors, which on average consists of only 3% Québečanů eligible for donation. " </seg>
<seg id="36"> Any healthy person at least 18 years old, corresponding to the criteria of admissibility, but may donate blood only once every 56 days to is six times a year. </seg>
<seg id="37"> 14% of people offering on average in the blood is taken, because they are, for example, such as AIDS or malaria, and the if they visited the country, where was acting up fever, are excluded for one year. </seg>
<seg id="38"> " with these 3% , we can keep the state which meets the needs of hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Deficiencies are very rare. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The members of the network of donors, however, it is necessary should be in proportion to age and can no longer donate blood. </seg>
<seg id="41"> But persuading people to give blood, it is difficult, in particular, is to maintain and encourage to become regular donors. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Life is now so unbridled that they rarely find the time to be able to donate blood, " said Francine Décaryová. </seg>
<seg id="43"> With an annual budget of $297 million U.S. dollars HEMA-Québec not only blood products, but also the human tissue such as bone grafts, heart valves, the eyeball, and the skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns. </seg>
<seg id="44"> These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before they are deposited with the HEMA-Quebec, who also manages the only public bank of blood from the umbilical cord in Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The umbilical cord, which was previously considered as biomedical waste flows with blood rich in stem cells, which can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia. </seg>
<seg id="46"> " A few weeks ago, we celebrated our thousand deposit a sample of blood from the umbilical cord to the bank, and we assume that they will take more than a thousand a year. </seg>
<seg id="47"> At The beginning of next year we should begin to offer for transplantation, " explains dr. Décaryová that the collection of blood from the umbilical cord describes as a very popular. </seg>
<seg id="48"> " some mothers are disappointed that not have access to it, " because HEMA-Québec do not have sufficient funds to enable the comprehensive and expensive program to offer to all hospitals in Quebec. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Views-The Orwellian discourse of Barrick gold </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the issue of 17 September published a letter to le Devoir Patrick J. Garvera, the executive vice president of Canadian mining companies Barrick gold. </seg>
<seg id="3"> With orwellovskou logic confirms that the largest gold producer in the world, began the prosecution of three of the authors and chudičkého a small publishing house for slander in order to provoke " a transparent public debate " and requires them six million. </seg>
<seg id="4"> If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, nesoudí the truth, especially in the case of proceedings for libel, but the law. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is no surprise that this crucial distinction Garver completely ignoring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Or perhaps for Barrick Gold is the best way to lead the public debate, to bankrupt anyone who would dare to defend the opposite position? </seg>
<seg id="7"> Whatever the trial, however, the authors and the publisher of the book Canada Noir (the black Canada) will be forced to spend the impressive amounts to be prepared to defend and fight in a very balanced fight with the military lawyers almost supported by deep pockets of mining companies. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Tactics in these outstanding fighting often lies in the ruined defendants in order to promote conciliation, which zacpe mouth of the counterparty and, in addition podes anyone who would dare to pay this matter. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If the company Barrick gold really wanted public debate should look at the whole thing to present public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Contrary to what is happening in some of the countries where it operates Barrick Gold, in Canada, a debate is under normal circumstances the exchange of ideas, and not in the stick in his wounds. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Thus, not enough mining companies than to open their books, their documentation and establish a genuine debate through the newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent scientific teams, which could bring the matter to light. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Barrick Gold, however, it seems, does not have confidence in the public opinion and generally refuses to petitions and letters in support of the authors of the book Noir Canada. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Perhaps Garver could explain what may require " public debate ", and at the same time, the views of the public to? </seg>
<seg id="14"> It appears that this word in the world viceprezidentově indicates only bold-paid lawyers, and not all Canadians, it is very restricted concept of the concept. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In a democracy, they have the right to speak and calumniator. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Barrick Gold or not-does not understand-that the public, which supports writers and publishers Noir Canada do so primarily because it rejects the brutal methods of mining companies. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Barrick The public is ready to hear and consider the matter, but to assess, on the basis of a civilized exchanges of arguments, but not in the context of what many perceive as the prosecution, in which they should be the defendant to stop his mouth (as part of its prosecution of " public debate " the company by Barrick, by the way, was handed an official invitation to the authors of the Noir that Canada to stop using the term ...) . </seg>
<seg id="18"> Apart from the surreálný Garverův speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick gold is a direct attack on the academic freedom of research and search for the truth, which are essential for any democratic society. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Overall, denies the right to quote of reliable sources, and debate on the facts and to the interpretation, which represent the intellectual activity itself. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If in a country such as Canada, impossible to study and discuss issues that do not like the rich companies of the world, without the out repeated prosecutions, who else will be able to do? </seg>
<seg id="21"> If the company Barrick gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could be if guided by scientific standards, using the authors Noir Canada. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Has the right to reply. </seg>
<seg id="23"> University environment, which appropriately, has been able to drive the debate and disagreement and conflict resolution. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Excessive application of Barrick gold clearly shows that, despite what they say, does not have the slightest taste of lead transparent debate. </seg>
<seg id="25"> For the university world is a loss, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it is time for the government to introduce measures to this type of irregular prosecution limited. </seg>

<seg id="32"> The Foundation gerhard Budapestért issued accounts for roughly four million forint for the Foundation Harmadik Évezredért at the request of the organization Fiatal Baloldal-Ifjú Szocialisták. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Head of Collab Ltd. prompted The prosecution under the fictitious account to one of the defendants Ludovic Györfy. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> However, at the request of the Ivan Kubátová Romanian masons based company Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Ltd. were and Jos-Investment pc </seg>
<seg id="43"> In fact, however, But one of the companies had not worked, according to the defendant because they work. </seg>

<seg id="53"> It May be more interesting, if it decides to reveal all of himself, the defendant János Zuschlag. </seg>
<seg id="54"> His previous testimony is not too detailed, and although he has already promised that all out at length, yet did so. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The question is whether it is in its interest-in return for the payment of a large part of the damage, 50 million forint, with the Socialists may have entered into an Agreement and Zusi, take it to him. </seg>
<seg id="56"> He is also yet to even insult, because his request for relaxation of the conditions of his detention, namely the placing under house arrest, has so far remained unanswered. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to their study, published in the journal Science, people do not want to type in the competition behind eBay auction, so that better pay and too high a price. </seg>

<seg id="7"> In both games participants can win money, but playing at auction, which is an important element trump the other hand, started in prohrávání intensive work unit located under the bark of the brain, called the striatum. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This brain region plays in addition to many other functions in the role of " sebeodměňovacím " mechanism of the nervous system. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is, therefore, according to the researchers Vyšroubování prices can be explained by efforts to avoid a violent reaction striata. </seg>

<seg id="13"> Members of other groups have also been promised that, if I will come from the game, they receive remuneration for 15 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The third group got $15, on the contrary, before the auction, but in the case of the loss came from its members as well as the money. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved by any highly impressive images even an atheist, but it is necessary to find a good photo. </seg>

<seg id="2"> On its tenth birthday Google may declare that people can find it in his pocket at least as well as the sky over their heads, they know where they were on vacation, on what is the professional examination and what is interested. </seg>
<seg id="3"> By Eric Schmidt, one of the leaders of, but still not enough. </seg>
<seg id="4"> However, as regards the skeptics, making parallels with Orwellian dark vision, it is not clear to the very nature of the Web 2.0. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Eric Schmidt, has recently expressed for the daily newspaper Financial Times that Google's main objective is to collect about users even more personal data, which is necessary to ensure that the founders of Google could keep their original intent, which was: Organize all the information in the world! " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to zpovídaného leaders Google stands firm after ten years světoborné work only at the beginning of that could work with any information. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On The question of what will be in five years, Schmidt replied that he would like, if Google was able to answer questions like " what am I to do? " Or " What work would actually be suitable for me? "-On such seemingly simple questions, however, software will not be able to respond until the user will not know enough information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Not all users of the Internet, we know that during the internet search accurately recorded as of the search terms, and to what IP addresses have been searched and which pages are candidates for the search moved. </seg>
<seg id="9"> With Personalized Search launched two years ago, for example, users can keep their surfing history, may be back to see what sought and what clicked, which is then in the long run they generate more adapted to the findings directly to them-the same logic will be based the Recommendations and service, through which our system will be based on the previously mentioned the basis of products and services. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> What if my information will be used against me, what if someone looks, how I deal with?-Ask users who are looking at the data Google monopoly of fear. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In most cases, operates much more scope to the potential represented by the company, does not backlash in Internet users aware of guilt, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or even revolt against authority. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, it is confirmed by the fact that all the search terms are not collected, but only in justified cases, may also be issued by a third party in such legal cases moral rights of Internet users did nothing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The best known example of the last time it was about a coordinated action against the Brazilian pedophiles, during which provide Google Brazilian government information, that permit the identification of the community site Orkut, run through it. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Internet users who worry about the moral rights, however, he could still in May breathe a sigh of relief when the company goes hand in hand with the organisation for the protection of the rights of the EFF to successfully managed to his right in a dispute with the FBI: Google may not be so in the future, nor any article of the Constitution forced to provide any information requested by the FBI secretly. </seg>
<seg id="15"> (at the same time, the federal government has successfully carve out of nearly 50,000 Web addresses and thousands sought terms, with reference to the strengthening of the years before the law on the protection of children, but nevertheless failed to get lists of wanted items to individual users or complete lists of Web sites and key words, including a period of two months. ) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> With a View to Google is so contradictory: it is beat those who fear of their personal data, because they feel that their private sphere and the private life will that start to use the Google service, subject to the injury, and the campaign against him with the revolt of belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And while American geek culture and its wild arm, incorporates around enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, which appears in many countries, see a new generation of s big, " corporation, now what is trendy, unlike its rival Microsoft, to be considered for Windows as the Conqueror the world, although both of fighting for the same objectives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> This may be due to the fact that, unlike Google, Microsoft does not require its users identification code and do not want them money for their application; an open, free and a fresh source of information and a package of the programs are much more available, as young, " coolovější " than the practice of official the software giant. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, this may be due to the fact that geekové accurately understand very problematic relationship of the Internet and the personality, which has brought of just one of the key words that nejskloňovanějších in recent years: The Web 2.0. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Web 2.0 is not about anything other than the cooperation that behind deliberately let the track and use the communication channels that are available, and although their range of each other, the essence remains the same: it is for the shows. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The average young person can now keep a profile on several community pages from Facebook after s of Xanga, you can still connect with other services, such as Twitterem or applications with last.fm, recording his Listened to music, all you can connect to navigation systems, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, moreover, can you write a blog, which will automatically be his latest gallery, which imposes on Flickr or Picasa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> In doing so we can learn about many of exemplary cases involving itself: a friend of the morning looking at the flood of pictures of common friends easily come to, who's having delusional friend spent the evening, or it may the company can out of its workers just because it on his blog portrayed your honest opinion of the top leadership: one thing is clear, the concept of private life is now completely re-evaluated. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The man, who lives online consists of what the show, so we can define the basic argument behind the behavior of today's youth. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And who wants to hide something, or at least avoid googlovskému monopoly, has the option to be starting Scrooglem, which uses Google's search system, but deliberately leaving traces) . </seg>
<seg id="25"> A Considerable number of people, for example, on does not register on the community site that they can not be found. Google's online applications from a text editor for fotoeditor a news portal and can be exchanged for an alternative version, which is not connected to the server parks and which of us giant form a profile of the highest quality possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Public opinion is not secretly expected, when Google shows teeth. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The firm has its current value of $156 billion worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars) , Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion) , AdWords and AdSense advertising space/threaten investment promotion agencies and the service introduced by the accelerating pace really embarrassing life not only to Microsoft but also many of the other software designers. </seg>
<seg id="28"> However, critics have found it next to the counterpoint operating disturbing impression: the top leadership, for example, completely rejecting the protests of workers after they drove up to double the fee for the business school, the like frequent daily diet of staff was under the management of the company too expensive, however, losing all in addition to the fact that Google is still in 2006, bowed before the Chinese government and in terms of their agreement vyfiltruje each award, which is abhorrent in good taste, or the interests of the Chinese regime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> One of the company's internal rules of is that no advance neinzeruje new services only when it is used, but it is certain that the expected problems coming months and years may move the world to new places: while some believe that Google's project focused on scanning and archiving of books and magazines take such proportions that soon will have anything to do with the U.S. Supreme Court, and others, are frightened of the Health System, there you can compile a complete profile of your own health with previous findings, doctors and problems. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The fact that Google compiles the genetic database, it may serve as a good starting then material, and for the next generation of sci-fi writers, famous the it Coryho Doctorowa " Scroogled " describes the orwellovskými reminiscence future, which may be the man with odstrašivě well bring in only with the help of data from Google. </seg>

<seg id="2"> What do you think was the best method of the evolution of the technologies are able to prevent collision, if not imitation detector barriers encountered in the world of nature? </seg>
<seg id="3"> For example, in the case of honey bees. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The idea of starting a strategic surprise project presented at the CEATEC Japan's Fair, of the president of the vnukli engineers from firm Nissan bumble bees. It was about how to build a new generation of systems prevent collisions. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In cooperation with the Tokyo University biomimetický Nissan built the robotic system of the type BR23C, robotized miniauto, of which is equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the ultimate objective of helping to create a system that can eliminate any reductions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> " during the flight, each bee creates its own personal space, oblong shape, which is actually very similar to our security protective packaging, " he explained at the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, the Director general of the signs for the technology industry and research and development. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The important role played by an to a compound eyes that allow them to see this in all directions in the field of more than 300 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The copied features a complex eye reached after engineers idea of the of the laser rangefinder. </seg>
<seg id="9"> He identifies the obstacles at a distance of up to 2 meters before BR23C to in the field of 180 degrees, calculates the distance and their send a signal cabin microprocessor, which is immediately transformed in the operation in order to avoid a collision. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Obstacle is detected during the fraction of a second, then begins to mimic the movements of robot-car bees and turning of the wheel to the extent necessary to avoid a collision immediately changes direction. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unlike any of the existing system that runs výhybný manoeuvre is completely this instinctive way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> " If it were not so, the robotic car failed to respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles, " explains Tošijuki Ando, head of the Laboratory of mobility and the robotic car. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Must react instinctively and immediately, because the technology complies with the most vulnerable and the inner layer of security protection package, which the deduction is currently regarded as inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The whole process must reflect what he is doing a bee in order to avoid further this. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This process may take longer than the blink of an eye. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, unlike the bees can not move towards the up, down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction from which you can rotate the wheel. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Instead of endless possibility that is trying to offer this, as well as in the case of the robotic car it was applied only vehicle to swing of movement, the acceleration and deceleration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means that they have a longer life than lithium-ion options. </seg>
<seg id="19"> According to Ando is important instinctive, intelligent response, not the ability of processing, the less the storage of data. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> This mechanism must prepare and respond to only a few incoming signals per second. </seg>
<seg id="21"> There is no need to keep and responded by using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, being used only on the memory size of a few kilobytes. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It Does not Need a memory of GIGA-or megabajtovou or capacity. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This is the first step towards the development of the technology for immediate avoidance, which is estimated to Nissanu to get into mass-produced cars in ten years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The other option may be a link to the satellite navigation system of GPS units, which would avoid the obstacles lies in the way led motorists to set up the final goal. </seg>

<seg id="13"> It is now possible to spend in the first round more than half the amount of 700 billion, so that of the 250 billion will be used immediately after the case is expected on Monday as Congress, and the Ministry of Finance for them buy securities secured by mortgages, which are classified as poor, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will depend on the decision of the President. </seg>

<seg id="13"> Looking at the results of the opposition plans to take industrial action, but rather seeks to deliver their message to voters about the need for economic reform. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> " With this, we are, of course, have a lot of the opposition we must print in hampering the distribution of local authorities, but even so I can see that change more and more people, including older, " said Milinkevich, with reference to the fact that the Lukashenko regime, that his greatest achievement as the creation of social security, not a right or officially supported by most layer of pensioners. </seg>

<seg id="4"> The soul, which is arrogant show by taking a vote, of which I spoke at the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This thing is just cited is, however, merely an example of the changes, the major changes to the current economic earthquakes have shown: not only in the United States, but throughout the West and perhaps not only here. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In both the US and Europe it seems that the crisis in this acts as an accelerator phenomena, which have been in the incubation for a long time, which, in the new climate utužují finally come to light. </seg>

<seg id="10"> In short, the crisis seems to be the world economically, but politically almost exclusively national. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Political Transnationality appears to be significantly out of the game and that has nothing much to say: clear evidence gave the European Union, which is divided as ever between the different interests and different national strategies and to be unable to decide on a common policy. </seg>
<seg id="12"> So everyone waits for action by the government of each country, emergency rescue plans, the revival of the market, the new rules, and the allocation of funds: when are we going to the emergency, only States have the economic means, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to give everything right. </seg>
<seg id="13"> And also owns the necessary funds and permission, to use two sources of immense value in certain circumstances, which perhaps no market and no international organization will never be able to have in a similar way. </seg>

<seg id="14"> This new emfáze crisis to státně-národní The element, which is, after all, in the full compliance with the increasing importance that is trying the latest economic developments attributed to one factor closely associated with him: to territorial jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we have entered into the Kingdom of the network, more sophisticated technology, imateriální, while we were convinced that the global finance has been fated to rule the world, nothing from nothing, we realized that our future will have on the other hand, are increasingly confronted with such little things as corn, diesel. </seg>
