The skips sorting of waste are not the perfume in Brno
In Prague the sort his drinks packaging, while in the villages of Moravia South you fall on skips sorting at every street corner.
And in Brno?
Here, it should be that you take several minutes to find the appropriate skips.
I do not mean that we do not trierait no waste in Brno.
But I have the impression that the councillors from our town, the second largest city, was not enough to this problem.
Brno in the stone age of the sorting of waste not only because the citizens can still sort that paper, glass and PVC, but especially given number of skips dedicated to these wastes.
Have you tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city?
It is a science, which requires most of the time and nerves of steel.
The only place that I found for the moment, this is the place of Moravia in the face of Potrefena Husa.
What Mr Onderka and his colleagues do not want to, but it seems sacrément shortly.
Without speak of the fact that in other areas of the city it is not an easy task.
Thus to many of my friends not sort their waste.
For laziness.
Ça their one is actually going on to reach the skips.
It does not surprise me.
Myself, after a holiday, I have proposed to go lay a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except that I have seen no colour lorry street Kounicova.
Fortunately I have found the right place to take the tram.
That said, the waste overflowed.
That is, after all, the centre of Brno, which is supposed to represent the best city, not? !
It is likely that ecology and so-called esthétisme are not too the Socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city a first league hockey which is a disgrace to the city throughout the country, instead of buying a few additional skips and propose the sorting of more raw materials for a Brno.
I am pleased to be able to strengthen my impression with official statistics after dragging a moment on the Internet.
data of society EKO-KOM, Brno really is the worst of all the Moravia region of the South.
The budget Paroubek has removed the argentaux pension and illness
After that the left has increased, despite the opinion of the government, farmers or the staff it may lack money for pensions, illness or savings housing.
But also for the interest on the debt or judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, the Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and the Communists, the increase for some classes, they rely on the fact that the Government will borrow money for sensitive, pensions or sick leave. ” It is that put the problems later, undermine the ground, " said Janota.
There is on borrowed money interests to pay is higher and that it will return sooner or later.
The State has not actually the choice of where draw money.
If it is not reduced social aid or its expenses, it will have to raise taxes.
To all those that the left has now increased: the firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And to their children.
The people will and should not fear for their pensions or insurance, including 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a greater debt of the State - next year it will not 163 billion in funds, but more.
Despite the efforts of the Minister Janota debt is growing more quickly, and with it the interests.
The State will need money for the repayer and there is more to slightly increase VAT or reduce the maternity leave the government in its package anti-déficit.
It will also miss five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to some groups of voters.
It is mainly what has already been decided and started which it is not possible to change the projects to reduce the costs.
All the retain, which is not free.
This means delay or halt 30 major projects, and the removal of European funds is also in danger, according to the warning Karel Hanzelka, spokesman of the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to resolve the financial deficit very cleverly - it will draw from the dividends of the ČEZ) supplier and distributor of power that the State has largely and contribute to the fund.
The concern is that the dividend is never certain and that there is no case of a well without substance.
Last year, 18 billion that have been navigués since the ČEZ in the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay the deletion of environmental damage, to supplement the accounts of the pensions or serve in the reform of the pensions.
Moreover, this gimmick is the real deficit of the budget of up to 5.7 per cent of GDP according to the rules of the EU.
And it is far from the end of the Carnival transfers.
The budget for various compensation to the victims of communism and offences, even the savings housing, almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It is a lottery.
If we lose a procedure, we must in any way the pay, Janota.
The minister will save of the side of the department, or at worst, reaching to the budgetary reserve of the government.
It also lacks one hundred million in cash for a two billion, which must monitor online what are the costs of each administration.
The first phase will start in January.
If the Finance Minister no money elsewhere, the project will have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone overcome two operating systems
In the future, American consider a mobile phone that will allow the user to move an operating system to another pressing a single button.
The projects that have been proven seem promising.
It is a button and you Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility is the goal of American society VMware, mainly of the software development of virtualisation for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate in personal and professional
The two will work, has indicated Srinivas Krishnamurti society VMware in an interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was introduced in November last year and was made a first demonstration a few days.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualisation on smartphones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test to journalists, a smartphone with two operating systems.
It is a Nokia N800 changed with a RAM memory of 128 MB, which served simultaneously systems Windows Mobile and Android mentioned.
The development of new technologies to mobile phones is booming.
society VMware works with European operators and American to test the virtualisation on smartphones, and customers should have access to aircraft during 2012.
The lack of snow in mountain concerns the hotel
The empty avenues were not a problem that the operators of ski lifts.
The lack of snow dissuade people book their holidays to ski in hotels and pensions.
De, it is always possible to trace chambers free for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have many visits on our website.
Internet users walk offers, asking prices, but did not commit to reserve for the moment.
And if they require, they are all on whether there will be snow or mud at Christmas, " said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl. Info.
If move on New Year's dreams to Špindlerův Mlýn, is too reluctant to respond.
If it gives priority to the economies and that the quality of accommodation is that, then we can try to wait a few days.
The hotel of Špindler offer to stay a week for the New Year.
I believe that they will try even a moment of the place, but they will make way for them and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free Chambers will soon decline, " said Jandura.
The tourism agency Ingtours of the two also proposes still beds of free for all periods of winter.
The week of Christmas us most at the moment, it is not completely sold.
It remains free, say, half of the chambers in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared a stays Christmas last minute less, " said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The tourism agency of the two may also propose the New Year to Krkonoše, but there is less free places.
The 14 days of February go well, stays hivernaux remaining sell medium.
This year, interest to winter has been negatively influenced by the fact that there was still no snow to Krkonoše.
The people expect it to get to.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If tracks will cover during the week, Christmas also will be complete, " think Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the hotel Horizont Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
It was a improvement of about five per cent.
There are few places for the New Year as for Christmas.
There was a great interest in the holidays January of the Polish and February sells “ informed Karel Rada, director of the best hotel of Pec.
The Omnia hotel near the parking central Jánské Lázně is also to 80 per cent during the period of the New Year.
On the contrary, half of the beds were empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, we have 60 per cent of occupation at the moment.
February is a little more low for now, but as soon as the snow will fall, interest in the Krkonoše grows still certainly indicated the director of the Omnia hotel, Erik Sporysch.
The hotel of the Krkonoše should not expect more snow.
Thursday, it will cost and rainfall, they should be neigeuses mountain.
but by the time should be warm, informed Jiří Jakubský station Hradec of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: iteration is the mother of wisdom
It becomes even comical, the hard effort with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of sage, the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, which he regarded himself as well.
When it eventually to reflect its doctrine ardently expected, it proved that he had recopiée paper from the Iraqi scenario of Bush three years ago.
Not content to use in the text several times the expression " as in Iraq ", it has not hesitated to use the title of the speech Bush's January 2007 as its own speech: “ A new road "
At the same time, he was personally criticised the idea of Bush to send new reinforcements to Iraq burned out by the civil war as “ irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences. "
The following months have shown that the Bush strategy, which was the recommendations of the commanders campaigns, was the only possible and likely success that newspapers at present do not speak of the whole of Iraq.
This has not enhanced the reputation of Bush, it said, objectively speaking, he has left his successor a final situation much more favourable could hope.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
This again commanders campaigns that have requested an increase of the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, which has even severely criticized the reluctance of the White House in spite of the habits of subordination.
It asked 40 000 in order to make the situation more favorable.
The President has hesitated for three months but a better option, at least it has cheated the general 10,000 soldiers.
to root out the promise of 5 000 additional part of Europe, even if it were on 10 000.
What brings the most problems in any strategy Obama seems to be its intention to withdraw the military in Afghanistan within 18 months and all conclude this process by three years. Any the Obama doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt the fact that an increase of half will bring the same fruits that the progress in Iraq.
In spite of fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders to honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands by the exact opposite - we cannot rely on person and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, difficult to prepare for the Afghan security forces, accustomed to change leader during the day that suits them.
political institutions, although officially based, will remain the eyes behind which will proliferate ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in light of the lack of clarity about the reports, which are further complicated by the influence of Pakistani and Iranian.
Even the foundation of a “ prompt to act ', which is the basic aim of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of the Obama strategy was perplexed by his determination.
In the past eight years the situation in Afghanistan has worsened and is now on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and the reality can be confident that small soldiers in the turmoil of the war for their " prompt return home " will bring a real miracle.
From a political point of view, set a date for the withdrawal of troops is simply irresponsible because the Taliban will be the indirect admission of defeat.
The last NATO summit has shown that the willingness of the Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is to negative.
The European policies do not know or do not want to explain to their voters what the Council in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor that alter the situation dramatically developments is linked to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and that the enhanced penalties have no effect on Iran, the US will face the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by military force.
It will respond by example when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops to Afghanistan.
Each solution of this kind will, however, a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only rustine for Obama is the fact that it remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for it is working on a new strategy, in case it prove to be a flop.
leaders of the bank Goldman Sachs will not receive bonuses in cash
Employees leaders senior of the US bank Goldman Sachs will receive this year of bonuses in cash.
The company announced to respond to strong criticism about its pay practices.
The group of 30 key leaders will receive actions instead of money, that they will not sell for five years.
The actions can be withdrawn leaders if they take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs raises in leading the effort to link the pay with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose that Wall Street is well aware of the sense that it should take, said the former banker investment Douglas Elliott of the society JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after being set aside almost $17 billion in premiums on the first three quarters this year.
For the current year, total premiums will probably exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the premiums of the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced Wednesday that it had a single tax of 50 per cent bankers ' bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.

The minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited in the Castle
The President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning, the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which reports its stay in government because of its disagreement with the State budget for next year as it was passed by the Chamber of Deputies
On believes that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota cabinet will be on the agenda of their meeting Friday.
Klaus also criticises the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which is widening the public finance crisis.
That is the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed of the meeting.
Janota then discuss its service Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget which will be submitted to the signing of Klaus, is a deficit of 163 billion that the Czech Republic should manage.
however, the Chamber of Deputies approved on Wednesday the proposals of the left on money transfers and increased the amount of staff, of the social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government accused proposals of the Social Democrats that they would increase indirectly the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement is born between left the Government, Klaus and the other, disagreement which calls into question the future of the cabinet of Fischer had been trained by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
The critics claim that the budget, as it was voted by Members, removes the package of savings measures passed by the government of Fischer and which must that contain the debt of the State.
Klaus, who can ratify the budget but that nothing, said today during a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, that the policies have long overlooked the " serious problem " of the " weakness irréfrénable " of the public finances.
At present there is, according to him, not positive solution.
Only a strong government could contribute to an improvement, whether it was based on a consensus of the political parties, according to the president.
The President of the ODS Mirek Topolánek has indicated that the budget is staggering and that the government should question the existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas said the ČTK that the idea of a cabinet administrative supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Greens is clearly more.
In its response, the Prime Minister Fischer has described as “ drastic verdicts.
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek has responded to Mr Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is appalling and it will exceed 200 billion kroner.
Wednesday, the ČSSD called the ratification of the State budget for next year.
The People's Party also was happy.
Morgan Freeman Mandela will play in the new film of Clint Eastwood
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by actors, the South African claim that the new film of Hollywood Invictus - Invaincu will the world many things on the country, its fighting and its success.
The story spoke of sport, relations between races and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, American actor rewarded the Oscars, embodies the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman said, that this is a Mandela aged ninety-one years to represent it in the film.
Matt Damon plays a more important role.
I said to him: “ If I represent, I should be able to see you personally. .
The actor aged 72 years was rewarded for a price for its role in the tragedy Milion Dollar Baby of Clint Eastwood in the middle of the boxing has, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery become itself slave, a President of the USA shadow, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone alive and also important for so many people that Mandela is.
The ex-homme of South African State 27 years was imprisoned for his hard work for the end of apartheid in South Africa.
It was released in 1990 and became chairman of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

The biggest challenge for me it was of course as he
The actor said that if he and the international political rights were in the same region, it would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, to be in scenes before his speech.
The more important for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I you, I recover your energy, it is transmitted and I had the impression of how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon played in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national team of rugby in which a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh environment of the rugby.
For him, her first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I come to the door of the house, I was opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was said: ' I look much more in the film. ”
Despite differences between actors and models, Invictus under the leadership of the director Eastwood has received positive opinion and even ambitions for the Oscars.

The mystery of the aura in Norway is determined: the Russian tested a rocket
It has been a strange visual phenomenon of unknown origin above Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence has recognized that yesterday have tested a intercontinental ballistic rocket near the Norwegian border.
The launch has still been a failure, and the missile “ Bulava " to be the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming the nightmare of the generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His presence repeated during the tests of the rocket has not had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, or Bulava did not boom, or it was damaged in flight.
The Russian newspapers talk about " Bulava ” and “ missile that is not "
A missile that is not is
The 13th test at the beginning.
It is only at the end of the flight that once again the damage on the apparatus.
It is clearly the engine of the third stage of the rocket that exploded.
This time, " Bulava ” boom of the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij which travelled under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can rightly be put to fire a boat in movement and submerged
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object precisely probably by a " Bulava " defective.
From remains, the Norwegian had not doubted it is a Russian rocket.
The general argue that this time we cannot talk absolutely failure.
The two first rocket stages have resisted and damage affected only the third.
In previous cases, the drivers have been failures of the first floor.
Even if no launches test without hitches, the direction of the Ministry of Defence considers that only six of 13 have been failures.
The success rate of almost 50 per cent fills therefore general optimism and therefore always a Bulava " fly without problems and that it will even ten nuclear cores hypersoniques a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.

Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The direction of the Hyundai plant of Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
That is precisely because of the frequent additional hours that the unions have declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesman Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai plant has confirmed.
The leadership wants to be put agree with the unions on a Saturday worked this year.
We cannot renounce our production plan, it is essential, that is why overtime volunteers have been proposed on Saturday, 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, said Vaněk.
The site Sedmička 1605 indicated that the company has proposed a bonus 400 CZK employees who would be part of the team Saturday.
It will also attributed a afterwards for the day worked on 28 November.
The society, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for hours, or they can ask a replacement leave on 28 December and extend their end of year holidays aindiqué Vaněk.
In addition all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for the costs of transport and for their lunch.
Given that the overtime was the most urgent and hot in the comments and demands of the unions as employees who have voluntarily stopped production last week, the management has taken the decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, said Vaněk.
Until last week, employees of the car plant were forced to work almost daily two overtime in their eight hours.
Trade unions are cancel the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The following negotiations between the management and the unions must take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to stop the rule of strike in the event of agreement on their claims and signature of a common document.
The situation in the plant culminated Wednesday when nearly 400 employees have spontaneously on strike because of overtime.
They were protesting against the poor pay and alleged hazing.
The defended herself with the fact that employees should work in addition to fulfil the requirements of the production of automobiles.
During the announcement of the strike Monday, trade unions have also requested that the ceased production are not subjected to any sanction.
The unions are calling in society to reduce the time spent in overtime.
Moreover, they want this year a reward of 5 million kroner) 209 about € (.
The car factory Hyundai of Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It has started production last year in November.
It has produced approximately 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars a year.
Czech Découverte: a substance that operates on the HIV virus " hard-working people " also
A team of scientists Czech and German testing new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it is also on the virus that have already developed an immunity to medicines.
This is, in some cases, over the fact that the combination is not as hard on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS.
It may extend radically the lives of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of the virus in the body.
Their consumption, however, entails a series of side effects.
The suppression of this increase was for the development of so-called resistant virus on which the drugs have more impact.
The Group of experts three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a response to the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are a collection of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination is blocking the development of the virus in a different way to all drugs used until now and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers work to discover new substances " improved ", on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanical connectivity on the protein of the virus.
The metalocarboranes have a single three-dimensional structure: two cages to multiple walls are trained by atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon and connected by a metal atoms, in this case cobalt.
A virus traitor and resilient.
The protease HIV is a protein of the HIV virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If we stop the protease HIV will also establish the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, the researchers explain in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations of two pairs of cages) see table (are connected by a court organic link, which is then systematically.
A little smaller but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the protéases HIV has been tested in pieces, as well as resistant variants, obtained from patients infected with HIV.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of the metalocarboranes is not as strong as on the clinical medicine, but it is not diminishing versions resistant against which the common medicines are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their mechanism of action single and their other properties as their biological and chemical, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are interesting combinations to consider more towards the development of drugs effective against HIV, said Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the laboratory of structural biology of the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and the Institute of molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over the budget. The ODS is Fischer defends
The President of the ODS) Civic Democratic Party (, Mirek Topolánek has described as " staggering " the budget to the next year and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The first minister called the ODS of drastic verdict.
He said taking time to analyse.
The spokesperson of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the idea of a cabinet administrative supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party functioned more clearly.
According to Nečas, the head of the Government should decide whether ilprend to the Chamber of Deputies support on the minority who cares to combat the growing deficit, or if he is to serve with the assistance of the parliamentary left.
Nečas has warned that the positions of the ODS and social democrats in relation to the problems of the deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies Wednesday ratified the budget for the year 2010, with the amendments to 12 billion included by the left.
The Chamber has increased the money for salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The grief of the government to proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they increased indirectly the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion.
The ODS left the meeting before the vote, obeying the desire of the government as a budget is a variant less bad that a budget.
Déception and unnecessary
The Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, the Prime Minister Jan Fischer has indicated that the Government will still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in case of ratification of the amendments, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota has made an appointment on Monday with the first minister after its passage in government:
It has indicated that there was asked if he would remain in office.
Sa disappointment about the negotiations of the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, which have imposed the change of the budget, have no place in government.
The first minister should also make clear that he will resign if the House ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit as e.g. health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the law on services.
Mr Topolánek: ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
That is the head of the Government Fischer and the government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing harmful, Topolánek has stressed in a statement textual since the United States.
He recalled that the deputy some ministries to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decided to resign at the fact of the fight against the amount of the deficit, " it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority which is currently in the House. ”
That said, it should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought and it will be on the agenda then I will, said since the House to journalists, the Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected to government precisely by the Democrats.
The Prime Minister Fischer has soared in the afternoon for a discussion of the Brussels European Council.
The ODS came back at the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas stressed the ODS would have probably voted Wednesday against the budget if it had not specifically asked Members Democrats to allow the vote of the budget.
We do not have the sense to be orphans, it is not small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not been accusations by the President of the Party in the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have been lacking.
I already knew when I renounced my mandate which would follow in the following months would be a bolchévisation House and destruction of everything that there were positive, reacted Topolánek in person.

The vaccination against pneumococcal vaccines will be free and optional
The vaccination against pneumococcal vaccines will overturn the old habits from January.
It will be the first to be free and optional for families.
Some already, saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free immunization against pneumococcal vaccines are.
The institute pharmaceutical already defined for the vaccine the maximum price that will pay for insurance.
Specialists are also clear in the process.
A new vaccination.
The free vaccines for children of August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated charge against pneumococcal vaccines.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If began the vaccination last year or earlier, we will have to pay yourself the following vaccination.
The first dose of the vaccine should be administered between the third and the fifth month of the child.
Last year already a quarter of families has voluntarily vaccinated its children against pneumococcal vaccines.
Yet parents pay 1600 crowns or more for a dose.
The vaccination of young requires four doses.
specialists believe that each year the insurance spends 300 to 450 000 in doses of the vaccine.
They save on medical care that children not vaccinated would.
So far the state spends an estimated 500 million per year for the child immunization.
The vaccination repaid was introduced with the package Janota ”.
The pneumocoques are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including the inflammation of the meninges and poisoning of the blood.
According to surveys in hospitals, there has until 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by infections of pneumocoques.
In the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the vaccination repaid.
The vaccination will be mandatory?
There are of the opinion regarding a possible compulsory vaccination in the future.
From January, it should be resolved by insurance and optional.
For example, the President of the Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
The Association promotes long vaccination against pneumococcal vaccines.
At an international conference to which our participated, have not been really pleased that we have a vaccination optional.
This is not ideal.
On the other side, we are pleased to be able to impose at least this.
I think it is a direction that it must now follow said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not change the process of vaccination against pneumococcal vaccines.
We are absolutely not for the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, say doctors.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Society of paediatricians, acknowledged that a vaccine based on the volontariata its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, we might consider a reduction of the renewal of the vaccinations, “ In the situation where the vaccine is such a sum I understand the decision making voluntary vaccination " said however Cabrnochová.
The experts predict that next year, more than 80 per cent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
The vaccination against pneumococcal vaccines marks a break because this is the first vaccination, which is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should free up funds for prevention, and conserving them on possible future medical care.
The doctors will buy their products themselves
That, however, is linked to the concerns of the paediatricians practitioners, related to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to make vaccines by doctors in the same way as other products of vaccine provided by the State.
Some Members concerned, however, that this would assurances " from the health insurance money. ”
Thus, doctors will need to buy the products and expect the assurances the reimburse them.
The pediatricians to individually invest nearly 40 million per month in vaccines, which is a substantial sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.

The Labour defends the tax increase.
Ministers have defended the tax increase and reductions announced in the report pré-Budget, despite criticism from the opposition, companies and trade unions.
The Tories have said that Alistair Darling has failed " an opportunity to show that it was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing its decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor has also drawn the wrath by low wages and salaries means.
Among its main proposals, we can see an increase of 0.5 per cent of the Social Insurance and a ceiling of 1 per cent on public wages from 2011.
The anger of the Insurance
The unions protested that low salaries are affected by a recession that they are not responsible and warned that “ problems ” s'annonçaient.
The diminution of the insurance — social which will produce about 3 billion GBP per year - has put the business world in anger, because that is a tax on jobs while the objective should be a recovery of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than 20,000 GBP per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
Issues of report PRE-BUDGET
The Insurance increase of 0.5 per cent from April 2011
The economy will encoreplus that 4.75 per cent expected this year
New tax of 50 per cent on bankers ' bonuses
The increase tax on the profits of the company for small companies has been abandoned
Rabais taxes electric cars and wind
Enlargement of the pensions of 2.5 per cent
According to estimates of the Treasury, a 30,000 GBP lose 90 GBP per year and a 40,000 GBP in GBP lose 190, while a 10,000 GBP per year from 110 GBP.
Ministers say their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 entrainait " difficult decisions " but stressed the fact that 60 per cent of the burden of additional taxes for the first 5 per cent of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, denied an increase in the tax and stressed that a reduction in expenditure was a " drop in the ocean " compared to what was necessary.
" These are important figures. They will halve the deficit, which will be absolutely necessary over the next four years ", he said to the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident and that the growth of the economy redémarrerait.
However, estimates of the Labour economic growth - which will influence the amount it will need to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be closed - have been put in doubt after the Chancellor was forced to revise its initial figures.
In his speech, he declared that the economy would probably 4.75 per cent this year - far worse than the decline of 3.5 per cent predicted in April - then that borrowing would be 3 billion GDP above the prior estimate.
" Need missed " '
Conservatives who will launch on Thursday a new advertising campaign warning against the " debt crisis " of Labour, said the project to borrow 789 billion GBP during the next six years was not sustainable.
Ministers have not managed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they said, ignoring " callously " difficult choices until after the elections - which in June 2010.
" They have anything significant on what they would do, ” said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary to the Treasury of the shadow cabinet. ” They had the opportunity and they have it missed. "
" The important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the victor "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour insists on the fact that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Tory proposals that would lead to a more rapid and more of the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised through taxes increase and decrease costs would be used to support spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were " built on the wind. ”
Nick Robinson, Political Editor of the BBC, said that the timetable of the announcements - such as increasing inflation for certain disability benefits next April, mentioned ci-dessus- would leave the Chancellor faced accusations of propaganda, the money is recovered the following year.
However, leLabour insists that additional assistance is provided when people in need and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
“ False budget
Although ministers have not published details of expenses beyond 2011, economists have argued that it was clear that the restrictions on public spending will begin to be felt that in the medium term.
The very respected Institute for Fiscal Studies of the Fiscales Studies (has said that the figures of the Chancellor, in the future, substantial cuts in many areas, including potentially transport, education, science and the defence.
" The pain is in fact that postponed ", said Director Robert Chote.
" The announcements the most important will be made after the elections, regardless of the victor, " added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to the accountants Deloitte.
" This was a false report of pré-budget. The markets will appreciate. ”

Thousands of people were arrested and dozens have been killed in Iran, after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has led to more major public events since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
Dozens were sentenced to prison and prosecutors say that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the detention centre Kahrizak.

Islam can be?
The pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, fans of the last book, " Why the French do not like the headscarf ”) 2006 (, an elegant study and well documented on an issue that concerned and has divided the country for 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today.
The last book of Mr. Bowen present a much broader and more ambitious.
Many anthropologist, it not only wishes to know what politicians and the media say on Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutions that are now in France this great eloquence. Bozen calls “ Muslim areas " for the 5m-6m Muslims.
It knows very well and listen to replicate the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
A Muslim must marry in a mosque or at the town hall) or both (?
The evolution and the rights of homosexuals should be taught to young Muslims?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim?
A Muslim can use a banking system based on the interests for a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which is the daily lot, rather than the political concern to the media.
The author identifies a new generation of priests, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown of the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate until the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts a Islam Sunni purist associated with Saudi Arabia which today are a small part of Muslims in Europe.
Mr. Bowen said that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French might be compatible.
But a compromise can be reached with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how French politicians) and the intellectual elite guardian if virulent of secularism (are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled by the Catholic report, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make compromises history with the secular Republicanism.
Rather than pragmatism, he detects a " narrow key values ”.
Islam can it be? After reading this book, one is tempted to say ' yes, but not yet. ”
The view the darkest of the world
The Arctic change more quickly and more dramatic than any other place on the planet.
The ice that the compose is melting at an alarming speed, carrying with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
The oil, gas, and sail in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now of the writers in their wake.
In “ On a thin layer of ice ", Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrateur, painted a natural history of the symbol of the great north polar bears.
Connaisseur history and complicated policies of whaling, he described the long tradition of explorers of the Arctic, which were shown in chasing the polar bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous aspirant 14 years had to fight as the tip of his musket-shape, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young oursons captured who were swimming with their mothers, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, a famous together 75 ours.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally a millionth of the surface necessary to an adult. the climate is rarely mentioned: a polar bear living in Singapore became Green because of the algae which in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and is often on the threat posed by hunters on the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continued in Greenland and Canada where hunters by helicopter and the Indians Inuit in motoski use fusilsd'assaut powerful drive their game.
Ironically, it is in the north of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain.
In his new book, “ After the ice ”, Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, provides a clear and frightening the science of the Arctic and a thrilling overview of what will be the future there.
Not that the scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmosphéristes nor the marine scientists can tell the exact speed of change.
This is not for lack of trying.
At nineteenth and early twentieth, travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen gave initial information on the melting of the ice cap.
The submarines of the cold war then mapped the change of relief sous-celle-ci.
The surveillance satellites and probes on the icebergs are of great assistance, but the bulk of the work is done by men hardened, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson, looking at the world special and tiny of the system dependent on the Arctic ice, formed by the nets of brackish water pressure by freezing.
But bear above the wonders microscopic contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the ice, between 2013 and 2050.

A US citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a US citizen who distribute mobile phones and laptop computers in the country, claimed the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. , based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific accusations have not been made public, although under the Cuban law, a citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of “ dangerous ”.
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and criticism, the risk of arrest.
The graffiti anti-governmental and speeches are regarded as serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bloggers growing by Yoani Sánchez, lead discussant popular often written on the husband and she followed and harassed by the agents of the government.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country receive rewards but permits have always been refused.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tension between the Communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that has a " soft " in order to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times, on Friday evening.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government advance by practical steps, such as releasing political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, in order that the US to reciprocate.
The mobile phones and laptops are allowed to Cuba, although consumer goods and new desired in a country or the average salary of an employee is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban Government has granted the ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for text messages or for a conversation in 15 minutes a day.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in hotels and luxury for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often must submit their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.

Most of the rare American imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berbena, press officer to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said it could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are a mistake.
One activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- have free mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the programme Americas of the group Human Rights Watch, which has recently published a report severe on freedoms in Cuba, called “ New Castro, even Cuba ”, referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his elder brother ill.
According to Vivanco, a defendant is often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably policy and that the Cuban Government is often a negative reaction in the US, when the two countries are beginning to initiate a dialogue.
The Pakistani authorities prevented a plot to send men in Afghanistan
Saturday, Pakistani authorities have identified an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five men of Virginia North in Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that this would remove a significant network of recruitment of terrorists scouring the Internet in search of young men radicalized.
The investigators have said that they were hunting a personality insurgente hidden, known as the Saifullah who invited these men in Pakistan after discovered when one of them commented approving the terrorist waves on the site YouTube video on the Internet.
arrived in Pakistan, these men have been guided by Saifullah who tried to help them to join the remote region of the tribal belt of Pakistan, al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the secret intelligence services who has been informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the commanders of al-Qaeda that these men were not involved in the plot of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Consequently, they have been isolated for days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the mountains prohibited of the north-east become a refuge of terrorism.
They have been considered as undercover agents.
That is why they have been rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities claimed that the men were determined and that they are still trying to obtain the necessary permissions to obtain entry in al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and interviewed by the FBI -- insistent on the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in the determination of the people in that trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US secret services have been priority to infiltrate men in the al-Qaeda network.
The recruiters organization play the role of gardes-barrières, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who can prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential American recruits are studied closely by al-Qaeda.
but they are also very attractive for the group because of their potential access to the United States targets and their value propagandaire.
However Evan Kohlmann, expert of the Foundation NEFA based in the US, said that terrorist groups should also be more attention in recent years in the choice of the people they accept because the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way that follow its recruitment model that other people have already? said Kohlmann.
The model is on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen for a “ action ” for the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants have market in the streets here Saturday, calling for a more important on the part of the negotiators working in the palace of the congress Bella Convention Center of the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000, but 25 000 estimates the police.
This event was held relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists had lit a few near a set of Government buildings, in centre- city.
As little has happened during the discussions on the climate law by the United Nations, thousands of activists market by the city, deploying banners in English saying ' every one is no planet B ” and in Spanish, saying, " The Earth said that it has enough ”.
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including the top model and Danish photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the home of his mother, Peru, has opened the eyes on divisive issues facing the country because of the impact of climate change that are already taking place. "
That is why I decided to join the great march -- the word and appeal to the leaders of the world to take the right decisions, ambitious and, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented demonstrators from coming too close to the centre and Bella has said that it had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they masks or that they were in possession of knives.
The police prevented demonstrators from coming too close to the centre and Bella has said that it had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they masks or that they were in possession of knives.
According to a passing for the anonymity because of its involvement in the discussions on the climate, the activists who masks and black clothing, have lit several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They were almost of the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, then followed by " a few big explosions ".
A within the Palace of the Congress, people were gathered around television screens to monitor throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that demonstrators have failed to wake up the conscience of the key authorities such as Su Wei, representative of China for the climate.
When asked if it was thought that an event would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied, “ In fact, something which I had no conscience.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring " The event is important, I cannot hear what is happening outside. ”
It noted that the march could be harmful or useful that the prospects.
It shows the interest of the public and sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other side, “ you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or they are damaging to the freedom of others. ”
The results of the tests reveal of the persistent gaps between the races
The federal report last week on the mathematics results provided good news for public schools in Washington DC.
Although the District is still far behind the institutions of the head, the report shows that the Grade 4 and Grade 5) cm1-cm2 (are much greater progress in the two previous years in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges of the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress) National Assessment of the progress of education (is the persistent gap between the results of the African American and white, both local and national.
The results child means white Grade 4) CM1 (to WashingtonD. C. increased during the past two years, 262 to 270) on a scale of 500, but those of their classmates African American women increased by only three points, 209 to 212.
The gap of success has in fact increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Americans in Grade 8) 4th (remains generally steady, only one point, 245 to 244.
The result means of White was not included in the results of the tests because the sample was not enough.
The overview on a period of six years is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in class of Grade 4) CM1 (, when the first NAEP report of the District was published, was 60 points) 262 to 202 (.
Although the results achieved by children in the two groups have increased during that period, the difference is only reduced to 58 points.
The week, some defenders in the District have expressed concern that rising celebrated by the Director of education group Michelle A. Rhee and the mayor, Adrian M. Fenty) Democrat (were powered by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean that we have the aggregate in the elements at senior level, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a group non-profit stands for equality in education of the District.
I do not immediately evident joy for one or two points earned, said Kwame R. Brown) related, Member of the Council of D.C. and whose daughter is in Grade 4, Eaton Elementary) elementary school (.
often critical of the management style of Rhee, Brown said that the message of the results of tests is that middle schools) colleges (of the city desperately need attention.
Really, you always see the positive signs and I respect that.
The fear is that we do not devote enough time and energy to our middle schools) colleges (.
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This autumn, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, designed the pupils of the end of the elementary and early college who have not incorporated the bases of reading earlier in their education and who are quite behind their peers.
Every day, the mathematics, for the Kindergarten) tongue (to Grade 6) 6th (focuses on games and experiences, such as they have been established in the District by former responsible Clifford Janey, which must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I think we must continue to work to provide better response to these students to lower level than the class, said Rhee.
Others feel that the results of the NAEP pose the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of education at the University of Berkeley in California that studied the results of the tests.
The conventional political solution is to spend your resources and your management reforms to schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
This targeting can have political consequences which this important programme.
But the problem, of course, as other Superintendant schools, it is trying to use the middle class white and black.
We focus for the development of a system of good schools.
We must strengthen our schools districts in order that all families, regardless of where they are from, be assured that their children can obtain an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendant schools in Newark, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap of success étaitla duration of public school traditional today to 180 days in the District of Washington, D.C., to be in competition with the Charter schools.
must be about 200 days to change, said Janey, which has come to an agreement with the union teachers last year to obtain 185 days as a “ starting point ” to obtain a further increase in the next contract.
To higher education a promise of future
The bus was arrested in Gettysburg College with a long sifflement.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, in descend and cligne a moment of the eyes to the view of the white columns, of the facades of bricks and lawns green pastures.
The parents of Graciela had only been complete high school, àEl Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, which was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
So, when she and other students Grade 8) 4th (of the group have explored Gettysburg where fees are of $38 690 per year, his attitude was less a new student impressed that enthusiastic.
Super is where I shall study! noted Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide the leading to the entrance of the building of the science.
Youpi, really? she said food for thought when he noted the low ratio law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that were visiting children during their journey of discovery of three days and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you are going to university:
The question is where.
Although this issue is still widely for the large number of American children born to parents Hispanic immigrants who have left the high school where parents have become in adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to university education which will enable them to enter the middle class.
In fact, ” a Hispanic “ second generation ” on cinqpoursuit its high -- a notable success if we consider that both parents immigrants, most of the Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without having completed high school.
Their success is important, say researchers, they pave the way for subsequent generations will play an important role in the workforce of the country.
The researchers studying fighters claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
There are also those whose parents set high targets to their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
The mentoring programmes also play a very important role to help Graciela and millions of children as it to the university -- in particular, if its efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, which has studied the Latin American students.
We must think to provide a support network for these children, until high school.
The federal programme which funded the visit of the universities Graciela is a good example.
Known as the ERG UP) prépares you (, it provides more $300 million per year of local schools to organize the programmes the university began when students of families on low incomes are in middle school) College (and continue until the end of years of high school.
Since 1999, the programme was followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering university, according to the United States Department of Education.
The Iraqi oil ministry received agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns on violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auction that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Ministry of the Iraqi oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
The companies are left with a participation in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven companies had paid to attend the second auction that began Friday.
The only had a auction has lost.
Two companies have obtained contracts for the auction in June.
The low representation of the giant American oil in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies were of Asian and European companies which pave the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil forum Forum, a site for information on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
The concerns about security, by coordinated bombings, Tuesday, and political instability as the American military troops withdraw have hampered the American companies, preventing them from entering with more force in Iraq that has the third largest oil reserve gross of the world, say analysts.
The companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, in particular the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and more willing to take risks because they had not accountable to shareholders.
ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only companies to obtain contracts with the Ministry.
The American companies, the most important, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong links with the Ministry of the Iraqi oil and provided their technical advice, left empty-handed.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, a more enchéri on contracts that other societies and left with significant holdings in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman of the Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be equal to its competitors and achieve its commitments in Iraq.
Companies pré-sélectionnées for auctions have made offers that were then compared the price per barrel as the Ministry agreed to pay for production above current levels for each.
One of the main organizers al-Qaeda would have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that a US missile that struck along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of the al-Qaeda operations this week, said Friday the United States authorities of the counter-intelligence.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against one of the terrorist leaders this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles in their car, on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to sources of American and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities have claimed that the missiles had been fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA, in the lawless tribal border of Pakistan.
They drove a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of the secret services Pakistani civilians, speaking on the telephone to Miran Shah.
the authorities have said that the local militant suspects fled into place and quickly confiscated what remained of the " completely torn body ”.
It was impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two American counter-terrorism representatives have given evidence not specified that Somali was part of the deaths.
Somali was described as one of the Responsible organizers al-Qaeda military who led the terrorist operations of the group out of the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize plots in the world, said one of the authorities who anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of the air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably comprised of conspiracies of attacks against the US and Europe.
It followed the instructions of al-Qaeda leaders and has translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority said that Somali had increased rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaida's and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It is perhaps not known of the great American public, but it did not diminish the threat it poses for us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important figure of al-Qaeda or the second leader Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, and three other operators.
The pace of attacks by unmanned CIA has declined since the summer, about six operations per month, according to the figures by the Long War Journal, a Web site tempered by a group non-profit.
The decline is perhaps due to improved tactics of the terrorist groups that have been reducing their vulnerability while killing also ruthlessly suspected informers, says the site.
The United Nations special envoy to Kabul withdrew
The United Nations special envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of widespread corruption during the presidential election supported by the United Nations.
The departure of Eide comes as the Obama administration decided to send 30 000 additional soldiers in Afghanistan.
envoy of the United Nations has said that he supported the increase but has expressed its concern regarding the timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and that would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, sending the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview of Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat has also urged the US and other military powers to increase the number of international staff assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase should be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said that it did not resign but that it would simply commitment to his family, in March, not spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon knows now that he has time to find a replacement.
I simply said that it was better to start looking for my replacing, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the start of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the United Nations, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
representatives argue that the name of Staffan de Mistura di has been mentioned; it is a citizen Italo-Suisse recently chaired a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who has previously headed the peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan has been tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential elections and to conceal evidence of electoral fraud.
Eide has denied the allegations but said that the accusations of Galbraith -- which has been thanked -- " have damaged the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism as regards international observation of the éléctions ”.
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate relief for US forces in Afghanistan.
It also urged leaders of the United Nations to allow his successor to hire more staff from the US and other Western countries that it is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that it would increase their confidence on how their money is spent.
Eide has expressed frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy regulations of the United Nations interfered with its possibilities for new talent.
United Nations rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It is appalling and it cannot last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers would impose " of the important additional sanctions " on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking at a forum of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a visit to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, a dédramatisé the possibility of military action against the Islamic republic.
There is no option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such an outcome. ¨
One of the things that I weighed the most, is that if I have learned a thing in Iraq over the last six years, it is the inherent unpredictable side in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions against the elite military and political Iran, but Gates has indicated that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the streets.
He stated that a “ range of incentives and punishments ” could be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would be in less good security with nuclear weapons ” because “ the people would suffer énormément'.
Friday, in a statement of the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined the European leaders in warning that Iran will face consequences " probable " if it does not reduce its nuclear programme in full compliance with the Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency) IAEA (.
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for peaceful purposes.
In the talks in Geneva on 1 October, it indicated that it would resume dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of its storage of enriched uranium in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a research reactor.
The administration has prompted such an agreement, develop a confidence on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to be removed attempts to agreement, in part, say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided on the fact to engage with the US.
Frankly, I think the inflexibility of Iran to some of the proposals of the international community in which they had in fact agreed in early October, has prompted the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, to join what they had not envisaged, in terms of important additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set 31 December deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before it turns to other options, including the continuation of this that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “ increased sanctions. ”
In a statement Thursday in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations has denounced what it calls " unfounded allegations " of some members of the Security Council on nuclear activities in Iran and said it has agreed to continue talks with the US and five other major world powers, " in order to obtain a satisfactory solution in the long term ”.
Gates, who had to return to Washington later Friday, met with the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the plane for the rich oil region of Kurdish in order derencontrer the leaders of the troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly on borders, property rights and the share of income.
Gates has urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid delays of the American plans to reduce the number of American troops, 115 000 to 50 000 by the end of the month of August.
Gates would also ease the anxiety of the Kurds on the withdrawal outstanding. The American authorities have quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: “ We will maintain security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq ”.
We will not abandon you. ”
In China, ageing, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband have grown up surrounded poster of propaganda the lecturing, “ The earth mother is too tired to host more children ” and “ A baby more is a fall more. ”
They have taught the lesson that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the low rate of birth of their city and the ageing of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and have begun to encourage young couples to have more of a child; their response has been instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
There is no second, Wang said, 31, Director of Human Resources and has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of children unique notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed the " small emperor ”, a crisis of the population threat the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, although it is expected that the number of residents of 60 years off, 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the global average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in the coastal rich cities with a population of highly educated, such as Shanghai.
last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the registered in Shanghai residents, while the birth rate was less than a couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission Population Municipale Shanghai and Family Planning (said that the fertile couples have babies to ' help to reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of labour in the future ”.
Shanghai is on the verge of becoming " too old - but not as rich, however - that the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden ”, she said.
A gradual reduction
Prepared in the constitution of the country in 1978, Chinese policy is to this day, without doubt, the obligation, the more controversial introduced by the Communist government.
The couples who transgress this policy may have to pay huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the countries to avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while the lawyers of the human rights have condemned the abuse in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority pregnant women have forced a second child.
Moreover, many couples have used selective abortion leading to a ratio of boys, girls abnormally high.
In recent years, authorities have gradually softened their stance on the one child policy.
In 2004, they have devoted more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of the cities, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which men and women are already unique children -- and in 2007, they have softened many of their slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, Professor at the Institute of Population Research Institute) Population Research (at Peking University, said that the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage.
In no time, the posters urging families to one child have been replaced by copies of regulations retailer that has the right to have a second child and how to leave.
The Government of the city has sent the family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples, their home, and the slide of the prospectus in.
It has also promised to provide psychological and financial those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
Answer disappointing
Although in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples seeking a second child after the launch of the campaign, the district more urban reported that there was no change.
The common Huinan, with a population of 115 000 inhabitants, for example, receives four to five requests per month.
The Shanghai officials, frustrated, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still not of approximately 165,000 -- slightly higher in 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Committee of the family planning in Caolu of Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason that many people do not want to have more children.
They want to fill their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they adoreraient have two children and that they are legally allowed.
But as many Chinese, they have only health insurance and life assurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The Western view of the one-child policy is a problem, said Yang, an engineer in construction which is seven months pregnant the first child of the couple.
That is true, we stand the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
That is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, human resources, has said that she wanted a single child because it was a itself. ” We were the centre of the family and used that everyone deals with us. ”
We have not used to take care of someone else, and we want to take care of others. ”
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a society of translation said bluntly.

The United Nations group a draft plans for the reduction of emissions
The climate conference sponsored by the United Nations -- which so far by placement disrupted and mutual recrimination -- is back in the spotlight Friday because of the publication of a document outlining the ambitious reductions of greenhouse gas in the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations supporting most of the burden in the next time.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, stressed the remaining obstacles, as it has informed the path to take.
But it was seen as an important breakthrough in the negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 leaders of the world coming next week in Copenhagen.
drafted by a special working group, the text does not say how rich countries give the poor to withstand global warming, and long term.
And it offers a broad range of options for key issues, including how the developed and emerging economies would reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be prepared to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt Representative àWashington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has written six pages of the document, considered a text of 180 pages to concentrate on what the Secretary-General has described Executive on climate change to the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, as “ full ”.
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations reduce their collective emissions in 2020, 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the country would reduce the emissions between 50 and 95% for 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually for the next three years to help poorer countries to adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, Friday, the same arguments, which dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, Representative of the United States negotiating climate has rejected any discussion that the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by industrialized countries, compared the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming harder to China that the Bush administration has it been there two years ago.
The US will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of the main developing countries, said Stern who also expressed regret that the text does not focus enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern has made her comments an hour after that the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs He Yafei has said that the principal negotiator American, or lack of “ common sense ”, was “ extremely irresponsible " for having said earlier in the week that the US would not financially China to combat global warming.
With the economic future of the major world powers, defects are emerged within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The battle is more the rescue of the individual economies that the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States acrimony on their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen countries most influential ignore scientific need to act more boldly.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting for who should bear the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases, even if vulnerable countries became more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters accountable for their actions.
It really is a game in which developed a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who is also Adviser on the climate for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put pressure to get them legally, in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that the negotiations will at least a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small states that peoples in 43 members, has drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Chief of the climate of the European Commission unit, said that the action of small island States has " put political pressure on the political process ”, in part by what they are now unified and they seek to emerging economies such as China and India, to act.
The debates have become a matter of urgency, while the delegates focused on the fact that they should solve most of the issues pending before the Heads of Governments come to an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Minister of the Environment Indian Jairam Ramesh and Deputy Minister Chinese took to the air and rushed to the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings in secret and conferences of information, in order to make claims will be considered at the following week.
The image of the gathering -- in which 13 000 people come in and out of the Palais des congress every day -- activists players guitar entertainment night making fun of the countries to reveal that the proposals are submitted and distributed on paper rather than emails -- is a true challenge.
The intensity is on the increase: almost all the ministers are important here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the big, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice-president for global policy of Conservation International.
The heavy weight.
In Britain the first train to 225 km/h will redefine the syndrome of the Monday
A 5h13 Monday morning, a whistle percera the night to point out the departure of a train that will mark a revolution of the transport in Britain.
The first suburban high speed of the country will reach 225 km/h, then it filera of Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first commuter train Javelin outside London.
It hopes that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast trains and reliable and will connect major conurbations of the Midlands, of the North and Scotland to London.
Small lost holes will become cities of suburb, periods of business travel will be long and the passage of the plane and car to train will reduce domestic emissions of carbon, while reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhering to this project.
But the ten billion needed to build a new rail network, the battle for planning inevitable and fears of risks for the environment may curb high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two) HS2 (, a company set up in January to achieve for the government a feasibility report, will make his document to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will provide a detailed map of the route of the next phase for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to West Midlands will be out within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres of the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 present three options for a high-speed network, to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a configuration Y for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line to separate in two or near Birmingham, with a branch to the west of the Pennines àManchester and Scotland and another to the north-east, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line through Scotland.
“ It appears that this will be the best option performance' said a professional of the railways.
When completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to travel an hour now.
The proposals will train travel to 400km/h, making the UK the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains 400m long and can carry 1100 people.
Until 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham.
A terminal for 20 passengers per hour would be necessary.
In the space constraints, it is expected that a existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Experts rail industry say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he feels that the project should be put in place, but public consultations longer and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if the machine, the network will need to be built part by party.
Trains will be first forced to drive out of the high-speed lines on the existing track north of Birmingham, retaining travel between London and Scotland more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure a passage of the aircraft to trains, as a point of reference for the revolution of the railways.
The taxpayers pay the loan of 75,000 GBP for the orangerie of the Tory
Alan Duncan, the main Member of Parliament Tory, made to pay the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of a orangerie that it has built in his house in his constituency.
The head of the party which has been demoted by David Cameron for complaining that the members of parliament were “ met ”, has increased its loan of 75,000 GBP to build an extension in oak at his second home, Rutland.
It had been authorized to pay the additional interest, hundreds of pounds a month to the taxpayer.
The authorities of the Commons have received complaints at the time and have not been asked by Sir Thomas Legg, which control of members ’ expenses. The last night, Mr Duncan said that complaints could be " clearer or more simple. ”
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of the parliament, owner of a house is two floors in a village of Rutland and Melton.
The neighbouring houses have been sold for almost £ 1 million.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and dining room, but the office of the emoluments said that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
last year, he added a véranda at home, describing in its plans as a orangeraie.
The neighbours described it as a " véranda for pleasure. ”
There has not been asked Mr Duncan to give an explanation for the increase borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee of the privileges and standards of the Commons, on its provisions for loans.
The Committee has cleared last month of any breach of the rules, after a survey on its expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan has changed the legal security of borrowing of 271.406 GBP ownership of London at home in his constituency that he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of the parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan claimed approximately 1400 GBP by months of interest borrowing up to March last year.
In April, its applications have increased by more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on the loan RBS Mr Duncan has not been changed at that time, suggesting that all increases to fund the borrowing of 75,000 GBP.
The interest rate standard variable RBS rose from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, nothing since then.
The latest publication of the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to ask 1 250 GBP in May.
Mr Duncan has lost its post of leader of the shadow cabinet in September, after a journalist in the supposedly filmed stating that the members of the parliament should survive " on budget " after the expenses scandal.
" In fact, it is now national, you have to live " on budget and you are treated as “ the m…e "
He said: “ I spent my money on my garden and I requested a small part, based on what was correct.
and I could ask sacrément more, but I have not done. "
The member of parliament, millionaire since his former post as a trader in oil, has begun to explain his expenses, in May, after it emerged he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the office of the costs " could be considered excessive ”.
One activist has dug a hole in the form of £ in the lawn M Duncan, to protest after it was revealed that it had requested 4,000 GBP for three years.
Asked on increased borrowing, last night, Mr Duncan said: " It was for improvement capitals, approved by the office of the costs and Legg. ”
He added: “ There is no problem of evasion or of development and use of the rules or anything.
It was quite clear in the rules permitted, etc.
This could be more net or more simple. ”

The association UDF increase the tone and the New Centre to use the acronym
The association UDF, controlled by the MoDem François Bayrou, responded Friday to attempted takeover of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, the acronym for the ex-parti giscardien, which is no longer use it on any support, under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced its intention to recover the UDF, ruling that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his legacy after reached out to the left.
The defense minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support its approach, it has received the support of the Member Hervé de Charette) ex-UMP past the NC (claiming ownership of the UDF for having been the first to file in 2004 at the National Institute of industrial property.
But Friday evening, the office of the association UDF, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou which will not be deprived, is his silence to launch a formal notice to the Minister and the request not to use the acronym and to transfer ownership of the brand, under threat of prosecution.
You have multiplied in recent days, indicating that you propose to your political movement of +reprendre+ the UDF, the association writing in a letter signed by 19 of 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Mrs de Sarnez of the MoDem party, as well as Senator John Arthuis Alliance.
You also need to follow on your equipment activist and on the front page of your site, the name of this movement, the +Nouveau centre+, of the slogan +l'UDF of aujourd'hui+, are also signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use the acronym, said the office of the UDF who met the NC withdraw " immediately the mention of the name of the UDF any support and that of) its (website ”.

Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine if, as is the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, it has benefited from a weak of the 80-year-old to deprive them of a part of its property.
The photographer for 62 years, known for its photos of stars, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years imprisonment and 375.000 euros fine.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the families of France, in which a mother and daughter are fracturing while taking the reins of the empire of the L 'Oreal cosmetics.
But the 15th Court also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87 years, should be carried out collectively by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L 'Oreal has always refused to submit to a review, not in the conditions proposed by the prosecution of Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors appointed Friday should report before 10 March 2010 by saying whether Liliane Bettencourt could be weak and what periods.
I think it will.
I will, said at the exit of the audience lawyer Ms. Bettencourt, Mr. Georges Kiejman.
For its part, the lawyer Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Mr. Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the court.
This is excellent news. The expertise will demonstrate that it) Mr. Banier (has handled this old lady that must be protected, he said.
For two years, the daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has committed criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist touche-à-tout, which it accuses of having benefited for years from the weakness of its mother to obtain a billion euros, in the form of cheques, life insurance or tables of teachers.
The Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, as a friend.
While the court should consider the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the arguments of the lawyers have sometimes turned to naming family Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt reported three letters sent by her) in 1999, 2003 and 2005 (to his notary, in which it said was wary of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: " could you explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years.
Françoise, I have never been able to talk to him since his marriage ”.
, the Office of Nanterre has again felt that the complainant was not admissible to act, particularly as a judge of the guardianship these days has refused to grant his request to open a process of judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt " a full capacity, it is not under protection and has not.
No one has to act in its place, ” said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court has decided that it would take action once the trial will be held on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Revolution managerial or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence has been vain…
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large enterprises to its employees, said the position of the companies to consumers before the revolution marketing: it is to join the staff to “ values ” determined from above as it was once, to impose the consumer products designed by technicians of the plant.
In the customer at the heart of the company, the revolution marketing handed the strategies of conquest of the markets where. .. although the authoritarian tendencies to products with the factors of preferences of the clienteles return regularly!
A demobilization of employees may lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon affecting in particular.
demobilization seriously affects the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including R& D and, still more, economic intelligence.
Indeed, l’IE ” requires of all stakeholders) ... (a proactive approach and forward-looking vision ”; it requires employees share a commitment that revenue management authoritarian are completely.
It is why we call for a managerial revolution to put the staff at the centre of the company the same client.
The value any relative of the opinion surveys internal
The opinion surveys internal –comme the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salariés- will encourage this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I am afraid not.
- First because I saw that, in a new situation, any structure comes after many detours, to make prioritairement… what it has always done. !
- secondly because authoritarianism –une of the pathologies of the pouvoir- increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of the human behaviour.
Among the major schools engineers, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopted by intellectual comfort, the old theory behavioriste, recently revived by the “ neuroscience " US and disseminated widely, unbeknownst to them by research institutes and the media.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to handle " levers ") sic (of the commitment of the frameworks, a recent survey d’Ipsos published in Le Figaro. reinforces the leaders in a posture of mechanistic governance, not the world ’ s.
Identifying and measure factors mobilization
Au contraire, the revolution managerial necessary to the functioning of the modern business, to adopt a final vision of human behaviour.
It is to integrate, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, commitment to the company is possible only if it is clear as a means to achieve their dreams, their ambitions of their projects.
Currently, only studies from l’Analyse motifonctionnelle adopt this design of the motivations of the employees.
These studies have shown that they consider their company based on a doxa predetermined that through their image seen, to assess what it offers to their projects of life.
With identification and the extent of these factors, business managers can control, and anticipate their “ social performance " and put their management of the resources in place ”.
They create a breeding ground agreed a robust economic intelligence and effective.
Speech Oslo: " just war " is praise right to Obama
The American right has welcomed Friday the speech the day before in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of " just war " against the enemies of the US.
Conservatives, who had brocardé the Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speeches, like Sarah Palin, former candidate for the vice-presidency of the elections in 2008.
I liked what he said, Ms. Palin said, égérie of the right wing of the Republican Party, the newspaper USA Today, adding itself have addressed the issue of war ” sometimes necessary " in his memoirs, just published.
The war is the last thing heard in my view that the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
It must stop these terrorists all there, she said.
Mr. Obama, who inherited two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday to Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain its decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers in Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, estimated that the president had done in Oslo " of the very good job ”.
I found that the speech was very well, welcomed the former chairman of the House of Representatives, which has particularly the reference to " the existence of evil in the world ” in the presidential.
For some side, I found this quite historic speech, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed in the radio programme, “ The Takeaway ”.
The former elected, regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said it was delighted to have seen " a left-wing president " to remind members of the Nobel Committee " they would not be free and could put a price if the use of force did not exist ”.
For Michael Gerson, a former boxer George W. Bush converted columnist in the Washington Post, Mr. Obama delivered " a very American. ”
In addition to appear in " citizen of the world ” as it always does ”, “ he talked as a US President, recalling the Europeans " whether they live in a bubble of security that they have not established and that they do little for the preserve, ” Mr. Gerson said.
Among the rare right not to be convinced, a hawk in the Bush era, the former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, has called the speech " dull, ampoulé and without inspiration ” on the site National Review Online.
A left of the President, the Democrat Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When is the war in the concept of justice, it can easily justify the killing of innocent people, he warned.
The press centre-left remained flattering to the President.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel was prematurely attributed to Mr. Obama, has described his speech " superproduction " even for a speaker, known for his talent.
The Oslo speech " should serve as a road map to guide decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression ", has ignited the California newspaper.
Mr. Obama " delivered the speech he was ”, the New York Times, deeming it “ both dark and inspiring ”.
Road: three marathons for an agreement that saves the supply of Christmas
After three meetings of the marathon negotiation process, the unions of the road sector and TLF, only employers ' organisation to be remained to the end, arrived Friday evening to an agreement to end the strike and the threat to the supply of Christmas.
At the meeting of signatures on Friday evening, the Secretary of State, Dominique Bussereau, was " pleased " that agreement, after several meetings of the negotiations, begun Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions the negotiators had left the morning light Friday, with the hope of signing rapidly in the late morning the text of the agreement.
And even if three employers ' organizations) FNTR, Unostra, OTRE (had slammed the door.
But it took another six hours a meeting began to 11H00 so that everyone is in agreement and to 18H00 the text was signed.
The conflict " would have been very damaging for business ” and “ it was feared that it would disrupt the Christmas years ”, said Mr Bussereau.
The text provides for a wage increase of 4 per cent for the lowest wages) in road transport, local and regional (and 2.9 per cent for the highest) international (.
In hourly rate, for the bas-salaires, “ is 8.72 euros to 9.06.
That is not much, but it is very far, explained Patrice Clos) FO (.
This is on will give the order to our activists that there is no blockages, not blockade of the centres of supplies.
But we can always have a few holdouts who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, chairman of TLF, welcomed " a good agreement ”, although it was " difficult to concede the rises on the top earners in view of international competition ”.
According to him, the increases will be of the order of EUR 170 monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the most senior.
It is the agreement of the good sense and respect for employees, said Dumont Maxime) CFDT (, while Thierry Douine) CFTC (has welcomed " a historic agreement ”.
Richard Jaubert) CGT (referred to " an acceptable compromise. "
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of the travel expenses of 3 per cent, and the general rule of the road transport, in the first half of 2010, including addressing the issue of a 13th month and modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that " a decrease of EUR 100 million of the charges employers ” has been the subject of an amendment government finance bill corrigendum for 2009, voted Thursday night to Friday by the National Assembly.
The Government will ask the Senate to vote " in the same ".
The signing of TLF allows that the agreement applies in a first time businesses belonging to this organization, and a second time, in any profession, in case of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It is will " as soon as possible ", Mr Bussereau.
The opposition of employer may only delay the process.
FNTR denounced a “ fool ”, because the EUR 100 million had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax. "
The Secretary? d 'Etat transport forced us to negotiate in? emergency, not in conclusion? d shared analysis, but to avoid antagonizing the eating turkey of the next Eve, deplored the Unostra.
For the Otre, the agreement risk ” of digging the grave, a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months ”.

The Turkish court dissolved the pro-Kurdish, far-reaching decision
The Turkish Constitutional Court has ruled Friday the dissolution of the main pro-Kurdish of the country, a decision which was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision may complicate the task of the Government, which is to reach out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society) DTP (has been dissolved because it had become a “ home of harmful activities in the state and its indivisible unit ”, said to the press the President of the Court Hasim Kiliç, at the end of four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously of the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven was required for the dissolution, Mr Kiliç, adding that 37 of the party leaders, including its President Ahmet Türk and the Member Aysel Tugluk, are banned from politics for five years.
The judge also announced the waiver of parliamentary immunity from Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and confiscation of the treasury of the assets of the party.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament) on 550 (.
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that the Members leave Parliament rather than serve as parliamentary without label.
The decision followed a process launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuse the DTP in “ guidelines ” of the Kurdistan Workers Party) PKK (, considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the window legal policy of the rebels of the PKK.
The ensures that it has “ no organic ties " with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court comes as the government comes to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to stem the support of the Kurds in the PKK and end the conflict.
leaders of the DTP claimed that a dissolution could lead to increased tensions in the southeastern Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan has degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
From the announcement of justice, 1,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the great city of the south-east populated in the majority of the Kurds.
forces have fired tear gas and used water cannons, while demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails and stones, with catapults.
About 100 people have also shown in Istanbul.
After the verdict Türk, stated that the decision of Justice would " deepen despair. "
Turkey cannot resolve this issue) Kurdish ndlr (prohibiting a party, he said to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
That will solve nothing, said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedoing of the democratic opening launched by the Government, commented on the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
can be expected, of course, with a response of the PKK, he added.
Thursday, the PKK has claimed responsibility for an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the most deadly of recent months.
The first snow could fall into
What would like Wolfgang Brauburger, it is a good winter.
But the manager of clearing and sablage roads) FES (said although this is not to annoy people.
It is simply so that officers can test the technical vehicles and learn the control.
And from the métérologues, that could be for this week end.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles is ready to tackle the snow and ice.
The FES follows a plan.
Mr. Brauburger explained that as soon as it is to neiger on the city of Frankfurt and night-time temperatures below zero, large vehicles sablage walk 20 major routes) routes (.
This includes the streets to great movement, the main arteries, as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
also include access firefighters, routes, pedestrian areas and streets in slope as the Atzelbergstraße.
The agents of the FES start their service to three hours of the morning.
where necessary, the 1040 kilometres of roads should be salt with a basis that is, in 3 hours.
That is why service of the FES begins to men of the morning " in order that the roads are released when will the trafficking of the daily migration ".
Where it is becoming more difficult, is when the snow is to à7h30 of the morning.
This causes problems, says the manager of clearing and sablage roads " because no driver is willing to let the vehicles of salt ".
Secondly, snow plus, addressing access roads and feeder roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The avenues and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger knows that it has always few complaints.
A five hours of the morning, the foot of the FES begins to reach the areas deemed to be dangerous and passages.
As for bike lanes, the services of the FES are generally not.
Mr. Brauburger said that there was in Frankfurt service spécialqui monitored the bridge between 22heures and 4h30.
As the ice to form very quickly on these surfaces, the vehicles of salt intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
Sometimes the police appeal to this special service encas needed.
The cradle of the dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae like other carnivorous dinosaurs: this bipède was about 2 feet long for 1.50m, its subsequent members were powerful, its skull lying was with sharp teeth and recourbées, his short arms correspondence of clutches in sickle and had a long tail.
If this case had lived a few million years later, it would have been exceptional.
But, as reported Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and his colleagues in the magazine Science on Thursday, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological features.
The animal was 215 million years to the New Mexico faisaità then part of the land area of the supercontinent, the Pangée and towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt said that the discovery of the Tawa sheds a changing of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, it provides information on kinship, distribution and the characteristics of these.
It is in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt has excavations in the company of other paléontologues on the site of Gohst Ranch north of the New Mexico
Randall Irmis of the Museum of History Naturelle Utah and member of the team searches tells their sometimes arrived to find a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer of Trias.
The scientists have quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The searches have updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginnings of the evolution of the dinosaurs.
The researchers have called the Tawa according to the word of the Indian Hopi for the god of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is a highly unusual discovery: the fossils of dinosaurs from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of bone incomplete.
All the experts in paleontology do not share that enthusiasm.
For example Sander Martin of the University of Bonn is not that this discovery is particularly dramatic, he said, however, it confirms some theories about the beginnings of the evolution of the dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, the dinosaurs appeared on the Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the fossil veterans are fragmented and incomplete which makes it very difficult the classification of the first dinosaurs.
The experts question to what time the sauriens were divided into three groups of major developments: the théropodes) finger (, which includes the tyrannosaure and the vélociraptor emerged later and that descendent birds, the sauropodes, quadrupedal animals in long neck, and those who are related and herbivores ornithischiens including species such as the triceratops and the stégosaure.
According to studies of Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first théropodes.
This case presents an interesting report features both primitive and developed, said S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found indications that the Tawa hallae possèdait small air bags in its bones at the level of the skull, as the birds who are the descendants of the théropodes.
These small pockets of air facilitate the breathing of the birds compared to mammals.
It seems that among the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially met.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest théropodes with small air bags in its bones.
As the related line of immense sauropodes also possessed of the air bags and a slight, that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the dinosaurs the most primitive known lived in South America, researchers have concluded that sauriens emerged there.
Therefore, three major lines of development are divided and was from South America to the rest of the world is to say all the land which formed the supercontinent Pangée.
That appears to be confirmed by the fact that the team paléontologues has also discovered the remains of two other théropodes which are not related.
The three species cannot fall to a common ancestor, who would have migrated, researchers.
Alan Turner of the Museum of History Naturelle New York and co-author of the magazine Science Studies said that there would have had at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are of course a few contradictions.
Martin Sander, paléontologue in Bonn said that there was a case yet, the silesaure, who lived in Poland today and which belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him give a distorted view because South America a large number of fossils of dinosaurs that have been preserved while there is virtually no on other continents.
However, how dinosaurs are they managed to become the tétrapodes dominant era secondary while ilsprovenaient a collateral relatively rare branch of the reptiles, remains a mystery.
At the time of the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, as with the ancestors of the current crocodiles and with many other sauriens.
Towards the end of the Trias the dinosaurs were divided on the planet and promoting the development of many new species, while others, who were related, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassique.
Such success is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander two assumptions.
There may have been a mass extinction to which the dinosaurs have survived randomly, while other reptiles.
Or then, dinosaurs were better and they have therefore been able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favorisal'épanouissement of a group of animals which had also developed during the Trias and since that time Having in the shadows: it was mammals.

The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
cannot put enough above the scale of the project Stuttgart 21.
For its supporters that is nothing less than “ new heart of Europe ”.
If. S21, it is more that burying a railway station, plus a huge construction which will plunge the heart of the capital of the Baden-Württemberg, in a desperate chaos of sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 1980s.
stations head, with which correspondence in the city, had a reputation at the time to be relics of the technique of the transport of the nineteenth century were effect of low-noise brake of the modern rail traffic because it was once much time to get the locomotives back to forward.
Arrival, short, departure – that is what to do.
That is why stations, head of the line must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart, too: a station trains, which is halfway around on the Magistrale Transeuropéenne of the rail between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava with the slogan " heart of Europe ”.
The project S21 will really start, although the visions of the 1980s are more long compatible.
Even the planners ambitious acknowledged that the cost to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
A true to say, stations, head of the line are more real problems for the entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with pieces and voiture-pilote at both ends.
However is now the achievement of Stuttgart 21 to one side of the new line inter-city in Ulm.
The regional policies and communal prevailed.
The company of the railways is the part because, it is the taxpayer who made the costs of the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public.
From urban view this project is relatively well.
The urban space which – according to the graphics of the planners computer-generated – will be very verdoyant.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The station and enlargement of the section are designed for trafficking which provided - and this is typical of the 1980s — an enormous growth.
A time there was not yet competition from cheap flights.
Policy of the modern traffic should first concentrate on strengthening the trafficking of goods because the transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not to freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the draft Schwaben.
It is the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain in the next decade that money will for other nodes and congestion in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport mentioned in all six major projects.
One of the most significant enlargement of the section is across the Rhine Valley 180 km.
Since 1987 the line is built.
It would be really urgent support here on the fungus.
But the draft S21 made a low-noise braking.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck of the goods traffic, and this in the heart of Europe.
The government considers the judgement on the airport
In Parliament regional Wiesbaden, the Land government has raised the possibility of judgment of the Administrative Court of Hesse on the prohibition of flights.
The Minister of Economics Dieter Posch) FDP (announced that the coalition CDU/FDP had for experts to review the legal point of view the judgement by the Administrative Court and is a document more than 400 pages.
The Court of Kassel was justified in a written document that should adapt the regulation concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction of the runway aterrissage north-west of Frankfurt airport would be.
The authorization to attérir for 17 aircraft between 11 and 5.00 of the morning, such as the Land government consider it, is not compatible with the legal protection of the citizens against air pollution at night.
The coalition must be decided on 4 January if it wishes to make an appeal against the judgement.
The opposition criticism this time and trying to pressure the government representative for celui-cirenonce to appeal to the Administrative Court Federal Leipzig.
The head of the parliamentary group SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to revert to their promise before the elections and to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be condidéré as a total failure to a floor.
It is sacrément difficult to be allowed to hold its floor, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir alluding to the slogan éléctoral of the FDP " We keep our promises. ”
The Minister Dieter Posch rejects the criticism Schäfer-Gümbel which claims that the Government of the Land tries to authorize the night flights using " d'avocasserie and roublardises ”.
It takes time to conduct a legal review.
The coalition does not take decisions on the basis of a “ first impression rapid ”.
The decision is legally reliable, said Stefan Müller) PDF (.
The interpretation of the opposition on the part on the prohibition of night flights is completely érronée.
The banks repay the aid
The big US banks, very affected by the crisis, reformed their links to the state.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion) more than 30 billion euros (for aid under the rescue plan Tarp.
The chain of American television CNBC reported in a news report that Citigroup was also planning to repay aid it received.
The banking institutions and seek to get rid of restrictions which accompanied the acceptance of, for example the restriction of the bonus awarded to the leader and that the settlement fees.
The Bank of Americaa launched a capital increase by the sale of securities to investors that he earned $19 billion of new money.
The rest of the amount comes from the coffers of the bank that are met through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis the Director General of Bank of America held to thank the American taxpayers: the injection of capital has helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had alleged in buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup is also considering the money on the financial markets in order to free themselves from the state.
The US bank could launch as early as Thursday a capital increase of $20 billion, was clear CNBC citing the banking community.
The spokesman Citigroup did not wish to comment.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Election accelerated
Finally it is past more quickly.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current tenant of the post of redacteur chief Nikolaus Brender by the chain German ZDF, the successor is appointed.
The committee wanted to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the drafting Berlin ZDF was the odds-on favorite.
The chain has not wanted to confirm - officially, the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
, however, it seems that there was also not more damaging to the due of the ZDF Markus Schächter if the proposal was not accepted by the Council.
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, need the vote of 9 to 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of the drafting of this.
two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Council to extend for five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender but this was rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council expressed their support for the continuation of Brender and 7 others had voted against the dismissal by vote of Brender represented a failure although predictable for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU majority in Council had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not to renew Brender to his post.
It is Roland Koch, the words of the Hesse who had organized a league against the editor.
He refused the contract of the esteemed redacteur chief is extended by invoking the rate of listening to the news of the ZDF had fallen under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, denouncing the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
A end even 35 experts in public law that had intruded in the debate and that the action of Koch was unconstitutional.
But it is lost.
Peter Frey: which is it?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 to Bingen.
He had studied the sciences-politiques, pedagogy etles Romance languages) Spanish (.
He then worked the Südwestfunk) body radio Rhineland-Palatinate (and the Frankfurter Rundschau) German daily national (.
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first magazine ” heute-journal ” today (.
May his continues, from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy of the rédacteur-en-chef; and related to Washington in 1991/1992, then until 1998 it was head and presenter of the " Morgenmagazins ”) information fortnightly presented the morning (; up to 2001 he was responsible foreign policy ZDF and head of the Berlin drafting.
After the disgrace of Brender, while it had just been elected journalist of the year by the journal Medium Magazin, the Greens have announced that they would lodge a complaint constitutional
The enemy of Koch in Council, the words of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the states should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF in order that the proposals of the due cannot be blocked by a political majority biased.
However, Beck has no plans to seek the withdrawal of the political members of the monitoring committees of the ZDF.
Peter Frey, the likely successor to Brender skilfully had manoeuvred to the Council of Administration in criticizing the commission vehemently in its decision to remove Brender.
Thanks to this display of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose for the post of rédacteur-en-chef without losing face, as the Council could elect it without the soupconne to put a partisan politics.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified liberal left.
Grand cleansing in academic
partial Success for students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory, at a meeting between ministers and delegates of the Conference of Presidents, an agreement has been developed that the working conditions of the Bachelor students or Master needed to be improved.
In the future, students should be able to overcome their studies.
They particularly of accordpour reduce the weight of the reviews: a single should enable us to close the module to study.
Moreover, the burden of work must be reconsidée to guarantee " of the realistic proportions and acceptable ".
The political authorities and institutions of higher education to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder also committed themselves to hold common structural requirements more flexible for the Bachelor and Master.
In regional level, it must not be different rules a Land to another.
Less than reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the other universities have constantly the expression. " étudiabilité ”.
But for the first time, seems to take a practical meaning.
The accreditation council has decided to significantly reduce the number of reviews: “ Each module should normally be concluded by a single consideration ”, in a document of 30 pages on the future admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, President of the Accreditation Council said that reducing significantly the burden of the reviews should be able to stop, that damage to the étudiabilité.
The " étudiabilité " should be, in future, the decisive criterion of the organization.
modules like the substance should be considered carefully to see if we cannot avoid this sensation choking in the sometimes in courses.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge RAID in Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg) CSU (is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should " have the opportunity and the flexibility necessary to enable and encourage personal initiative ".
The new regulations will access to new cycles but will also be adapted to the existing cycles.
These cycles should be " réaccrédités " every five years, which means that it is only in 2015 that all cycles have been considered.
10 agencies accreditation organizations on the entire country that depend on accreditation council established by the Länder.
In October, Education Ministers had put some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes are not too and the regime of the reviews not too strict.
In some states, universities and high schools specialized have already agreed with their regional ministries to take the appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only Land to have agreed to give more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorielset strengthen the offices of educational guidance as well as offices of the reviews and international relations
The Länder and the universities provide a budget of EUR 10 million.
in early 2010, the Government wishes to submit to Parliament a amendment to the law on institutions of higher education.
Following that there will be no more make one consideration to close its studies.
The organization of the studies will have to be more flexible, more must be able to ensure the recognition of notes other institutions of higher education and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, étudiabilité " of all cycles will be considered.
last Thursday, the government and the opposition have again discussed the issue of conditions in the country.
The décisionsont appreciated but critical voices.
The President of the students union Socialists reported that the organisation of education policy is more in the future ” behind the closed doors " of the Ministers and other universities.
The latest after the strike, the students as people should be able to speak a little.
Future diplomés higher education received the support of the President of the delegates of the Conference of Presidents) 1991 (Margret Wintermantel: " experience of the students is very useful, " it said Thursday during a meeting with Education Ministers of the Länder with which the 1991 is working on a project of common reform.
For the union of Education and Science) GEW (decisions taken in Bonn are not enough. It seeks the right and opportunity for each graduate Bachelor to enrol in a cycle of Master.
Andreas Keller member of the Steering Committee of the GEW also requested that the Länder provide students Bachelor today, that tomorrow there will be enough for studies and Master of study conditions as good as possible.
The Länder must hire more officers.
The Education Ministers have not raised the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
is by these words " Arrival in Germany and is beautiful, almost more control. .. ” that begins poet Werner Söllner, in which he thématise in bribes of phrases, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who won the freedom but lost in the same time his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 to Banat in Romania, was first Professor d’allemand and d’anglais in Bucharest and, subsequently, director of the collection in a publishing house youth before heading to Frankfurt.
Söllner received different literary prizes; in 1993, it was the highly coveted poetry of Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 is director of the forum of the literature of Hesse in the home of artist Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
did much of him in the not literary circles last Tuesday at a congress in Munich, whose theme was " The German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files ".
Clearly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged in its fellow writers germano-roumains such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer he had worked as qu’informateur police policy Securitate.
Söllner has received in 1989, the price of the German language together with some of the participants.
The tests d’enrôlement started insidiously in 1971.
I am, Söllner " is someone who has not sufficiently resisted auxessais intimidation of the Securitate. ”
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter) Walter (.
Almost simultaneously with l’honoration of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its literary conflict copies with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, in a case that clearly shows the abyss and the low level of political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, so to say according to current knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim.
In his own Securitate files, IM Walter has played a role, Officer Michael literature Merkel after the confession of Söllner and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter, who had intervened in its favour.
" It was able to draw all the difficult situations at the time ", according to Merkel.
Merkel has felt the need moralde to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner fit his statement and to the public was unexpected, though admittedly a former dissident its collaboration with the secret services Romanian is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a reservation for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper Die Zeit ", after reading the 914 pages of its own record.
One can assume that the victims will be made of the speculation and sometimes guessed what real names were hiding last names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
On the contrary of Germany between the consultation time of the Stasi is a reliable process, the attitude to the legacy of the files of the Securitate is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been frustrated and slowed in the past.
This is in 1999 that a National Council for the institution Birthler was established to work assimilation of the archives of the Securitate) CNSAS (but the return of the files a rather long since.
In 2005 a law that defines the management of the archives.
What influence former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very high, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, said in a trés dismissive to the winner.
It had a psychosis, and in the end it had questioned only once.
L’infamie power expected to speak here, without any gene, under the pretext of freedom of expression.
Of course, much of the inevitable questions are related to the case Söllner as so often happens in a context of guilt hidden.
Why now? Who has been stolen? The weighted reaction of the audience, admission of Söllner, suggest that this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge that accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of l’oeuvre of Herta Müller, who yesterday received the Nobel Prize, is more than a footnote.
Tumultes in the Champions League
On had the impression that he was there, spruce from any right of Christmas party, nice, on which the manufacturer sportswear had spread its goods when the new coach VFB Christian Gross monta at midnight quarter in a Mercedes class C, it had just called a plastic bag orange of the supplier.
The rights, including the skull chauve drew attention, allowed himself to lead in the city was still.
Otherwise our 50-year-old could have taken the wheel – had not drunk alcohol and it was not drunk happiness.
He spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow it would resume work.
It is now that it would start.
words Switzerland that we had to three days earlier were clear: “ We have achieved the eighth final, is in the league champions thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni Romania " but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success. This will be a brutal struggle for not back ”.
The “ big ” us on Sunday.
Here, it is repeating in Mainz the results of the league champions.
And it will overcome the shortcomings that have resurfaced after the three goals summary of Marica) 5 (, Träsch) 8 (and Pogrebnyak) 11. (
Drawing the sort
The eighth final of the Champions League) match up 16/17. + 23/24 February/return match 9/10. + 16/17 March (will be drawn on 18 December to Nyon.
The joy of entry into service fulminante of the successor of Babbel was moderate.
And the joy was not only moderate among those who brought a chance, who forwarded to Stuttgart destabilized, motivated and the pleasure of play.
I have been see the players and I told them they should focus on their strengths, I advised to be more courageous, explained the " plumber souls " – Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so bienmais, which no longer effects with the soigneur Babbel.
It has triggered a certain magic, did doctors Jens Lehmann - in favour of Babbel -- ” in the foot when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that we would never have thought possible ".
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of pause for injury, it argued as the best player through its dynamism, tried to describe the " phenomenon " found by a proverbial " wind " and the working method of the new leader: " It is someone who takes action and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation ".
But apparently Babbel had failed.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the course, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart a particularly need tenacity.
Just as Gross, the players and the manager will keep overvaluing the victory against a defence completely outdated and weakened to Romania.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening to Leverkusen with 0: 4, objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, signala they had achieved the goals of the season but there were others who were still well below.
We have not passed the difficult course.
What Heldt his 40th anniversary was not the heart to celebrate, even after the first home victory since three months, is of the events of the weekend a television interview of the goalkeeper Jens Lehmann fit back just before the beginning of the match.
There are decisions that others take and not Jens, affecting Heldt, in response to the criticism of Lehmann.
It had accused the direction of style and said it had decided to change coach under pressure from fans pubertaires.
Lehmann had also tried as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele that day of free after matches has been deleted.
The Lehmann were marked by a pure selfishness " ground Heldt and announced the consequences for the goalkeeper.
They could become a friends for life these two quadragénaires.
In any cast, they agreed to everything else, that is to say that without the work of the group trainer replaced, the sports and combative would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants have been “ for a large part in the success " rétorquèrent Heldt and Lehmann together – and the same rights in plastic bag acquiesça.

The case Kunduz
frontal attack the opposition: the head of the Parliamentary Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Ministry of Defence Guttenberg to lie in the case Kunduz.
The SPD parties and The Left) die Left (called on the Chancellor of the explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After consideration of the latest information on the air attack in Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg) CSU (for délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The Minister has intentionally, " a fiction ” on the deadly strike two tankers last September, said the head of the Parliamentary Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday over the issue of information of the ARD chains " Tagesschau ”) the newspaper 20h (.
Clearly, this means that it lied.
The killing was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force security in Afghanistan) ISAF (.
That is, in essence, the content of the report before NATO and which was read by Mr. Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new revelations of the media, the objective of lafrappe was in reality, not to destroy the stolen trucks, but much to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the investigation report of NATO, 142 people were killed or injured in the attack American air that was launched at the request of the German Col. Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left have requested Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel) CDU (, to take action as soon as possible before the federal Parliament and reveal that Guttenberg knew really on the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast believe that Mrs Merkel must say clearly whether the strategy of the targeted killing is part of Afghan policy of the Government fédéralet if the chancery, army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects the criticism.
The chancery in no facon influenced the army action in Afghanistan, he said.
Saturday, were stronger in doutesquant the real reasons of the reference to the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to the information of the newspaper SPIEGEL, information that they had handed over to Guttenberg on the attack of the tankers were both accurate and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden Minister some awkward details.
In the entourage of two senior officials suggest that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of the Colonel Klein as well as a report of the military police.
The " Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung " reports that Wichert would have meanwhile asked in a letter a clarification of the facts.
Until now, it has not answered
Saturday, the Ministry has not wished to comment on these accusations and referred to the Committee of Inquiry Federal Parliament which would be the Wednesday following in order dapporter light on the matter.
The worlds of the dream
Some see, while awake, images and hear voices that nobody else is neither wants.
It is not only among mentally ill, or under the effect of the drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality are confused.
Until they manifest themselves during sleep, everything is going very well.
When we are lying in our clouded chambers, we can play without barriers to dreams and fantasies wildest.
However, awake, experience of dream, and see things that others are not as reputation in the Western world to be mad or drugged, or at least be an original.
Such images and voices are not that among mentally ill or under.
It is our imagination that is in question: is the same neuronale which allows us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, but sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream, madness and the reality to blend.
A state of stimulation aware, taking the form of a dream, may be in various forms, in the best case is that of the visions, the worst of the madness.
But even though the trigger and the differ, visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castañeda, the latter of the chamanes, psychosis and hallucinations are attributable to the process very similar.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmettrices of the brain — first the dopamine, the norepinephrine, serotonin and l’achétylcholine - is broken and that the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
The complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often for a schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of attraction land has more power.
Since l’antiquité, philosophers and doctors have always looked on the relationship between the madness and the dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of rêve-éveillé; Wilhelm Griesinger, a founder of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 " a great resemblance between the madness and the dream ”, to Sigmund Freud, the dream was " a scare with all irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that the composed ”.
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into in a comic strip.
His body is in two dimensions to the glaring colours.
L’attraction land has more power on the plane tsunami of the ceiling.
It is a coup.
Behind him creatures of the devil ailées, grimaçantes, mouths bloodied, showing the teeth.
They continue, give the legs with heavy boots bold, the cast against the wall, it feels the pain throughout the body.
A thundering, evil, rant, walls and radio.
In the bear those voices that l’insultent and l’humilient.
Henning T. around two cables its chain stéréo, in fact a loop and l’attache to a hook ceiling.
It is on a baffle and the loop around the neck.
It is obvious.
The loop stands.
Whether you serve lesson shout the voice in a chorus to extract the Rupture. “ Go in a clinic and am good care! "
Today Henning T. 40 years ago, he lived six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first of 20 years ago.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: psychosis schizo-affective, paranoid, in addition, it is maniaco-dépressif, it takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
During the fear I have experienced terrible fear and despair.
The illusions are a cruel reality.
A% of the population suffers at least once in her life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics is the most common illness after the Depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, people can be the difference between the world of procedure and the outside world, they find themselves in a state d’hyper excitement, which is that they can suffer d’hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear of the vote – who commanders, who criticize or dialogue.
The optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The person cannot distinguish between the important and l’insignifiant, the brain can no longer filter the stress signals, the aware is drowned in the sensations.
Like the dream, the psychosis opened the gates to a tide of ideas and following fantasies of the deeper layers of conscience.
The perception of reality in the psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry of the CHU Heidelberg) Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum (.
The schizophrenic is in the centre of the situation, meaning focused on him.
At the same time it in a passive role, it is as in a dream, overcome by the events and may not act on them actively.
That is why schizophrenic often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust the reality, the illusions are a cruel reality, up is excluded.
To experience once in her life a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, " the sensory structure and the reality is seen during the psychosis, is fundamentally retained ".
The thoughts and delusional hallucinations are based on the reality, the alienation of the experienced a real framework.
Why our brain is this kind of speaking., is still a mystery to scientists.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to temporarily lost the perceptions of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the only factors.
Researchers assume that the persons concerned are petty brain damage.
On the maturation neuronale of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, said Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained, that is how the anomaly of the system neuronal occurred and the fact that it is not for many years.
The environmental factors also play a role – the stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, if there are susceptibility.
Similarly the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on the neurotransmitters.
When our brain boiler.
This crazy, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck is that the psychotic suffer their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to undo while others buy drugs dearly for it.
The perception pleasant or unpleasant of illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten brings together for ten years on hallucinations and the phenomena of illusory images: last year he published his results in a book entitled " The unreal world in our head. "
The hallucinations form part of the phenomena typical psychoses but also an impressive number of many other diseases.
On among them psychological problems such as the borderline or depression but also the migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer ’ s or the head trauma.
It is surprising that in certain conditions even the brains of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten consist of fragments of memories, which normally has been withdrawn.
They take form when the areas of the brain dealing with the sensory perceptions, are hyperactives or not enough refrénées; when our brains fuel but also when there is lack of stimulation.
The drugs can trigger this as a brain injury or a psychosis.
But the lack of stimulus, stress, the sorrows of love or other mental states.
In recent studies, one third of the participants recognized have made at least once in her life experience a hallucination.
In 2005 Sarah K. 16 years ago, it is a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and it is going to high school.
A young girl on normal.
If there were not the images and voices.
During the break, a young boy, thin, long hair châtain, the floor.
When it meets its peers are watching surprised – nobody else does or is this boy.
They believe that this young girl timid is a rêveuse lunatic but Sarah K do not dream, it is certain.
It is drawn, and this boy as it is and the girl who is sitting next to it on the bench.
It can even see its presence temporarily.
It is a pleasant sensation, it is the young sympathetic.
Am I mad? , t it sometimes.
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
The night appearances are frightening.
Often the visions are cumbersome.
When it is in class, it can complete the course because the professor is just presenting a new student in its eyes and ears when it is invisible to others and that the professor is clearly attempting to explain the equations to the table.
The night appearances are frightening.
When, in the dark of the chamber, it expected the sleep that too often and far too late, it often cannot distinguish if it is drawn or dream already, if the images sees it, the faces grimaçants or the girl with cuts sanguinolentes on the arms and legs before its eyes open or closed.
Let me quiet, Cree t such creatures.
It is not nor her parents and friends, they took to a mad.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. has now 20 years.
It had its ferry last year and she lives with his friend.
A year ago hallucinations ceased.
Since it entered into by internet contact with the psychologist Kasten it knows very well that it is not mad.
The folly is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or has not sufficiently stimuli, the likelihood is that it has hallucinations after a certain time.
I suppose that the brain is not enough, that we have the leadership.
Sarah K., single girl, fear of the other children when it was small and often played alone.
The hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years, that rights it called Daddy, since it was age, was not his real father.
The same brain areas that are active in the visual hallucinations and acoustic, and for the impressions and real noise, it is very difficult for people such as Sarah K of the difference between the illusion and reality ”. Each experience ”, according to Kasten " in the brain, the reality is formed.
The hallucinations are also of the images in the brain, that is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten, dreams at night are also a form d’hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenic, the mentally healthy person is able to recognise that the fantasies are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises its patients to cherish the hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is a step between the dream and l’hallucination.
In our world too focused on the conscience has, unfortunately, quickly to the imaginary experiences for diseases, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and medical director of the clinical psychiatry and psychotherapy hospital Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious disease, painful but which also contains something positive, creative — the madness is a work of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the form so-called experience oniroïde, a particular form of the amendment of the conscience being stirred by the dream.
The experienced oniroïdes are semi-rêves very complex are seen as genuine by those who live and can differentiate the same dream when he is in.
The conscience oniroïde occurs during a trauma or in situations of extreme conditions as for patients polyradiculopathie which fully aware, have a paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of itself and of the world, due to a total failure and sustainable move, it replaces the real situation that affects his life, by its own imaginary world which is divorced from reality.
It is a state of mental limit between dream and l’hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of a place, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
This is a form of means and interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, an organisation that is given to men, to avoid the suppression of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurichois Peter Classen Cornelius, historian of art also described her experiences oniroïdes in his book “ Change of Heart " such as safeguard action of the soul.
It has 49 years, when his aware for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body was sentenced to stand still in intensive care.
Claussen plunges in a world that has created, visit foreign travel in time. It is old man bed in a sanatorium, a robot in the room while on his health.
It lived through age among the noble producing drugs blood.
It is abducted by a Greek riding motorcycles that l’emmène in his country, he surfing with his hospital bed in the névé of the Alps and a Korean mafia.
It s’absorbe completely in this imaginary world, everything is even real later recollection.
According to Claussen these domestic travel differ fundamentally any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he wrote in describing what he lived.
On the contrary of dreams, the memories from travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It may say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real.
Much of this lived ignited the horizon of our other experiences daily, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, the delusions oniroïdes, psychosis, hallucinations and experiences psychédéliques show us how our internal representations of the external reality are fragile, even in.
Any change to the state of consciousness, summarized the psychologist Kasten " can lead to a distortion of what we call the reality. "
A experience that can be also enriching.
The first snow could fall into
Burda
A 27 years, children will result in the house of editions.
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of the editions Burda is an intermediate solution: more long-term, Hubert Burda wishes that his two children to the press group, he said to the newspaper Spiegel.
The holding company should remain 100 per cent a family business.
Hamburg - A long-term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees its society in the hands of its children
The two children will inherit in 27 years and are committed to mainstream society, said Hubert Burda, 69 years, Spiegel.
All the details have been resolved in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the business will thereafter.
It will also see if they are capable.
You cannot impose its children to 7,500 staff without knowing if they have the capacity.
This will demolish the children as well as the business.
Burda had said last Thursday that it was of the post Président-Directeur-Général in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, is a member of the Board since 1999.
It was first responsible of the technology sector.
Subsequently it held of the sector Treasury is to say that he was responsible for the capital of the company and following the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he was the head of the marketing of the sector, printing and Finance.
Thus for the first time this is not a family member who is leading the editions Burda.
Children of Burda respectively 19 and 17 years, his son Felix that today would have 42 years, died a few years ago.
The nommination of Kallen also serves to make the connection of the 10 or 15 years "
Burda said that the holding should remain 100 per cent in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always held in families that have left lead by a bulimia, which have made enormous unfortunate speculation that they could climb higher.
This has never been my strategy.
I have never been rêvede universal power, said Burda.
I see absolutely not in the role of coach of the country as could be, Springer and I do not intend to be part of these leagues as the Time, these companies have taken too much importance.

Mazda3 i-Stop: A sportsmanship sustainable
Mazda will prove that the spirit of sport is not angry with respect for the environment.
In this effect, it has to include on the Mazda3 system warrant and start-up of the engine, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for now, that is available on the engine 2.0 petrol 150 horses.
The second generation of Mazda3 s’illustre by good note that it has obtained.
The details, finishing the vehicle, l’habitabilité, behaviour, mechanics, the system i-Stop…
All these aspects are outstanding on the new Mazda3.
In beginning with the driving position, it appears that the preliminary seats have a ergonomics and a fixation.
The reach of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
By continuing with all trained by the control and console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese to create a futuristic internal design, with many buttons and controls, as well as the vivid colours of red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, the Honda Civic.
therefore we can say that both the Mazda3 that the Civic, Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of the German products, particularly with the Golf Volkswagen, that all want to surpass.
By continuing with l’habitacle, this compact Japanese car introduced a housing more than sufficient for four adults to travel with a level of comfort.
This blatant all this a large boot forms.
The warrant system and automatic start-up of the engine, at least for now, that is available on the gasoline engine of two litres and 150 horses and with manual change of the six speeds.
The engine is a true happiness. It s’illustre by his wit, his low noise, its benefits and control of its consumption.
In effect, although the Mazda3 demand are the diesel models, those who are not a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its ease of speed, its consumption.
On the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the however, i.e. with the largest number of series.
Among the equipment, it lane change) RVM (which removes the death, controls traction and stability, the regulator, the Interior photo-epilepsy, computer on a screen large size, the parking sensors, air conditioning, the sensor of rain and light, the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio, as well as the wheel alignment of 17 inches, are particularly remarkable.
Moreover, as if this equipment was not enough, this version available of the Pack Premium which, for EUR 1 500 more, includes, among other elements of the adaptive headlights bi-xénon and an audio system BOSE with shipper of discs.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It s’illustre in particular by the quality of the materials used, by its conduct and its equipment levels high.
Moreover, those who are not many kilometres per year can opt for i-Stop associated only with gasoline engine 2.0 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which lies between 21 770 euros for finishing Luxury and 23 270 euros for the model tested, the Sports.
In return for this significant sum, the Mazda3 we will each day a large dose of satisfaction.
" First " luxury
L. A. covers the red carpet of sensualité embodied by Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have ever blinded, dressed models as elegant as sexys for the exit of Nine. ) Photos: Gtresonline (.
Our " Pe ”, as sophisticated qu’habituée, opted for a " lady ".
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that can only look its e-mail, without the possibility of even see some type of attachments or surf the Internet.
It used its five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine the act as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see in the streets, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a prize and a monthly subscription very low, less than half what it costs, for example, l’abonnement data of l’iPhone.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service data to life for six times more expensive than Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The web is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is also limited the grand-frère American, but with a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those travelling with a Smartphone already know what the data when you cross a border or desperately sought a cafeteria on the WiFi) or a connection of Fon (to check his mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and that was long it should operate.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and options travel, but for me, I would have made a PhD in physics for the understanding and good glasses to read the small print.
The reminders on repeated the European Commission to propose roaming fees affordable in all of Europe had a barely discernible.
On the outside of his native country, hesitating to use the data, and it was not wrong.
journalist light aircraft such as the FonPeek) it is always curious that it is Fon then it does not have the WiFi (offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are starting to think differently and are considering various proposals to use their network of data.
Kindle is another good example, it includes the download books and other research on the Internet.
Without subscription and without soup.
It is a connected device and it pays in his purchase and not every month.
And it is this that I hope one day for the FonPeek: a purchase with access to life as Peek proposes already in the United States.
I do not want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I would simply because I believe that is more just for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The colour preferred Michelle
The yellow is, without doubt, the favourite colour of the first lady of the United States.
If it went to the inauguration of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a robe and a coat of this colour, it has chosen the same to accompany it in the second time, without doubt, the most important of his life: the Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama had a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to the colour ressemblante, a yellow building towards the green of the brilliant reflections, the two times, comprised of three parts: the robe, the jacket and the coat, in the same tissues, and was unsure of great embroidery or a necklace.
If although a first glance, it would appear that the first lady of the United States follow the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to deliver the same.
But the fabric which are both sets them very different.
If for office was a embroidering thick, however, it was a velvet Oslo printed.
The materials also are different: green shoes to heel for the first opportunity, and a similar model, but Golden this time.
The hairdressing also has changed: hair are now records when it all was dropped.
75 per cent of working mothers have been professional problems because of their maternity
The discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the young generations who want to be mothers.
that the study reveals " Fertility and career women in Spain ”, carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with l’Instituto of.
inquiry, carried out on 9 737 women 15 to 75 years, leaves no doubt: 75 per cent of mothers who work their careers have been limited because of motherhood.
study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, if the woman is working or not and the type of employment.
Those who did not work outside the home, part-time work or have a little stable work, are as couple, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
In contrast, women with a stable job, mainly in the public sector, postponing the entry in the relationship and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years old with a fixed have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after having installed as a couple. This increases to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector. ” These data show that women with a stable job needed more time in their lives to achieve it, which has led to the postponement of the union and the arrival of children.
Furthermore, the type of employment exercised influence widely, but at least the start date ”, said the researchers of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level is another factor that is widening the gap of the age of the marriage of the women and their first child.
According to the investigation, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child.
The difference is also among the women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years, those who have a basic and higher have been mothers for the first time to 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
“ Another disctinction is also among the women, according to their level of education.
While those who have done studies basic marry and have their first child before finding a stable employment, those with average or above reverse this programme and give priority to achieve a stable work as a condition for marriage and a child, ” said Mrs Delgado.
Diane Kruger also applies

A cowardly attack
last week, my mother, which has about 70 years, was walking in our neighbourhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent beside it and our dog, a sang-mélé, saved the SPA and not weighing more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they assenèrent two legs who grew the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is great because we cannot see what is d’amusant to attack charge a small animal defence which, moreover, was in left.
It must add to this the indignation of a woman strolling calmly and that, when it injuria these individuals, came to fear for his physical integrity, since énergumène who attack an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an elderly man or, ultimately, any person more low.
L’épisode took place about 5 p.m. on a Tuesday as another in a normally quiet.
The dog has gémi throughout the day.
We have of course filed a complaint to the police station of the same neighbourhood if we doubt that serve to much, and not to touch the sensitivities, we want to just say that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
Indignation led to condemn this.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to find amusing to mistreat a free animal defence which we now affection, friendship and we would like.
We do not know where is the proper education and the respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for the helmet
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, in collaboration with the Spaniard Foundation for Road Safety) Fesvial (, has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmets, mainly among motorcyclists, as has been said today the two structures.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of the helmet, since it is the only protection to avoid injuries to the head, or even death, in an accident on two wheels.
Michelin has indicated that the campaign had in line with its commitment to road safety, " goes beyond the design and manufacture products always safer " and said it contributed to this objective by other actions to educational and informative.
The new campaign of encouragement of the use of helmets in two wheels, under the motto “ To be or not to be ", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages of motorcycles, in order to ensure more widely.
Finally, Michelin has pointed out that road safety is a constant concern " for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop products always safer.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles began to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6 per cent compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures of the employers ' organisation of the manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, one of the dealers.
It should, however, to qualify the good news, since the reference for comparison, the month of November 2008, was particularly bad, with 60 per cent reduction compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the region last month, the accumulated registrations in those 11 months are 40 per cent below those of the previous year.
Since January, if we add all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles) derived from cars, pickups, pick-up trucks, vans and light trucks lightweight chassis (95 853 have been sold.
The big clouds affecting the calls have not provided. Indeed, although they are also bought by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100 per cent of cases through an external financing.
Thus, restrictions under the control of bank lending, other factors such as the rate of unemployment or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In this situation and the difference of the cars, aid to the purchase of the 2000E have little used.
In addition to individuals, independent and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicles under 3.5 tonnes with a level of emissions of Co2 only 160 grams per kilometer, may also benefit, but the number of spoke for itself.
Yesterday, among Ganvam, it reminded once again the need for the administration to attach attention to these vehicles and industrial vehicles) trucks and buses (.
combined dealers for a 2010 similar to that which is, for which it is a drop in sales of cars and 4x4s (of 19 per cent.
Aid to emergency braking is now compulsory
As with anti-lock brakes ABS and as the control of ESP stability, the emergency brakes will be a compulsory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if its mode of action, it can also help prevent many rear shocks.
L’assistant in emergency braking is increasing the pressure on the brakes in emergency cases detected by the system through kick by the driver.
But it is not always the pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident did not support on the brake before the collision, and half of them had not taken advantage of strength.
Until 1 100 accidents
intervention of aid, in revancha, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance of the car needs to stop.
According to a study of the EU, if all cars were fitted with this type of elements, up to 1 100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularisation of the so-called intelligent systems of emergency braking: it is a disaster on four of the injured would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera, detect obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it means increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device has maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimise the damage.
General Motors postponed until January the plan for Opel
While the workers from Opel's Figueruelas) Zaragoza (have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors) GM (Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably the 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer has warned it will need more time to conclude the contingency plan, Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be first submitted the workers and the governments of the countries where the factories, be postponed until early 2010.
However, GM, it provides a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is not surprising, that the Swedish Government has intensified the pressure on the US manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM agreed to be in contact with possible new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converg, took importance.
In case there would agree with any of them, GM could sell Saab to Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab by the end of year if it is not sold.
The wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
In designing their last and precious jewel, engineers of Porsche left the Boxster S and managed to l’amincir nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1 275 kilos.
This led to, first, of the automatic roof which has been replaced by a roof " manual, reducing 21 kilos, use of the aluminium doors as those of the GT3, 15 other kilos, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the petrol tank of 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilograms of earned, of the bacquets sport, still 12 kilos, and with tyres light of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they have renounced the audio system CDR-30, winning six other kilograms and replaced the poignéesdes doors by the wrists in tissues, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model are also with the PDK dual clutch, the test was done on a model to manual transmission of six speeds, mainly on the roads of the secondary network of California mountain, with sharp particularly tortuous.
His behaviour cannot be described as d’irréprochable.
The diminution of the weight does not prevent the car rolling on the floor with aplomb.
On the contrary: this was a long time that we had not tested a model as small and light, at the same time, guarantees the security in bends, including at high speed.
It is a small athlete, capable d’échauffer its musclesà speed for the necessary time, until we ask him to sprint, slow, recover and grow again moteur…
That is out what we wanted. Through its direction, communicative that said, the car will this qu’indiqueront our hands on the steering wheel.
And it will do so with a surgical precision.
Son of engine will
The son of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower) 10 more than the Boxster S (is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the “ sport ” or through a system that changes the rugissement engine used already on the Panamera.
capacity up is brutal, the ruling or hopping.
The suspensions are strong, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The pavement that we have travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was rather spoiled, but the car has managed the chicken.
The electronic assistants were barely act of presence throughout the journey, while on some disagreement we have found ice in the morning and gravel, later in the morning.
Ultimately, a car ultralégère, more entertaining to lead and is more than a simple change of the Boxster S.
The car will be at the sale in February 2010, at a price of 70 831 euros.

Brazil fixed a date for the start of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president should abandon the legation diplomatic no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, on turnover of the embassy of Brazil in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to Globo TV that " Mel " knows that they must leave the embassy, where it is refugee since 21 September, before that date.
" It is aware that must be based on 27 January, at the end of its mandate, it must seek a different destination ”.
The chain also cited the former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline: “ My position is to leave as quickly as possible, naturally with the support of the Brazilian government, " said Zelaya by telephone.
After the elections of 29 November) during which Porfirio Lobo was elected (, Zelaya had assured him that it would remain in the embassy of the Brazil until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, since Zelaya refused the condition d’exilé political qu’entendait imposing the government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After Rose days since the spring, during which asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty there arises again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents take decisions on a future.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize the debt by buying direct asset and indirectly providing liquidity to rates close to zero, so that financial institutions are buying the assets to mobilize.
central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have been almost finalised, and without altering their political 36-year-old maverick liquidity, are beginning to put a bit of sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with their award to a year next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic recovery without unorthodox measures and we are seeing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of scholarships and business obligations have risen again, although they remain distant levels of paranormaux they have achieved at the start of the year.
States were forced to socialize the risk private and public debt in again.
There is a flight towards the quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been chosen shelters by investors, thus increasing the differences between the countries of the euro zone and Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard& Poor'sa threatened a new downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of the moral hazard, trying to cause a case for lesresponsables global economic policy that had stalled the destructive effects of the credit limits on the destruction of employment, whereas what should be done is announcing a new d’Action pardons.
However, Dubai is like a tribal fight between the sheikhs to restore the power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections and a new government that finds the pot in roses.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly rational that ECOFIN saves Hungary a non compliance with its external payments at the start of the year and allow a member country of the euro zone of not respecting its commitments.
What is logical, is that the Ecofin Council has prompted the Greek government transparency and makes its citizens share the need to extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its finances.
If, as we hope, we face an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excesses in high positions, it would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, as our differences of public debt increase to the extent of the obligations European companies, nousn’avons not to worry.
If the European lessened and gaps that our continued to increase, it would then a idiosyncratic risk.
affair Standard& Poor's is a story. When our indicators standby force most services studies to anticipate their models and to revise up their forecast for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission to the charge with a Japanese model pourl’économie Spanish, it does not much hope for.
Again, this has any air of an excellent opportunity to buy assets Spanish, even if for now " caution is the mother of safety ”.

The President d’Iberdrola, Ignacio Galán Sánchez, was the first to speak yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, which is discussed these days the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades.

For the president d’Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 000 million until 2020 and 60 000 million and 2030, in the case where nuclear power stations now in operation would remain open.
If not, the investment necessary not incurred to 60 million but to 95,000.
However, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investment should not be on the increase of production capacity, but the distribution networks and the interconnections.
From 2020, the question change, and it will increase the power.
The challenge also focuses on the central gas to coal, with mechanisms of recovery of the carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, 18 000 MW of more are needed, with other " energy support ”.
Galán, who believes that the draft law sustainable economy that the government has just approved is in line with that calls for its business, has not wished to address the royal decree aimed to encourage consumption of coal, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there was a clear long-term " in this direction, despite the measures “ ad hoc ”, such as a qualified the President d’Iberdrola.
Nevertheless, Galán believes that the investment decisions, although they are on the long term, should begin to be taken, because they are some time before reaching maturity, and a stable gainful framework is needed to address them.

Indeed, the competition has distributed 5 362.5 million to 105 teams) 12 Spanish (who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, in the 1992-93 season, according to UEFA.
The Real Madrid and the F. C. Barcelona have been well served at the division.

The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, in the face of 5.2 received by the other members.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will at least 7.1 million and a maximum 31.2 million.
Furthermore, the Barça pocketed 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup in Europe in August.
But in addition, the payments, which are enshrined 337.8 million.
This money is distributed to value to each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four places attitrées.

New tools for expertise of the cars
In these days of bad weather and accidents, the vehicle garages are not the only winners.
Every day thousands of cars that have been a disaster are reduced to a garage, where an expert to evaluate the damage and the cost of repairs.
Each disaster is different, and the cost of parts of time and labour can be a long and complex work.
Calculate the cost of compensation between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labour can take two or three hours.
In contrast, with the assistance of the computer tools, this would be a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100 per cent of the experts use such systems.
The suppliers of services and solutions for the assessment of the sinister and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, and then treat them and offer their customers in the form a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American group Solera, is the leader; 80 per cent of the estimates are carried out with its products.
The other companies in competition in the field of tools for assessment and the information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director d’Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in a different format.
Moreover, the amount of data to deal with is constantly increasing, so that over the past five years, plus versions, options and motors have been launched over 15 years.
When a new car lots on the market, these companies are at work.
It is a very hard work, because each catalogue of the thousand pieces of the vehicle and include its price.
In addition, there is a graphic image “ intelligent ” of each model on which we can click on different parts of a car.
If it is a model sold heavily, the work can be ready in a week if the process moving very quickly.
If there is a car little sold, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex provides complete information on 99.2 per cent of cars sold in Spain.
Among the models more exclusive, they have such information on the Porsche, but not the Ferrari or Lamborghini.
On the vehicles in circulation, the figure is 99 per cent.

The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas) Madrid (.
Here, more than 100 technicians) in general experts in mechanical (are working on three computer screens.
Audatex invested each year 90 million to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are stored, and customers receive updates every two days.
drafted this huge flows of information allows companies to give them different practices and products.
most frequent application to the repair and maintenance, but in different countries, there are tools for the management of spare scrapped or to calculate the sale value or residual of a car.
The only company that provides a guide which provides information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex suggests not in our country, but the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it may provide for professionals in the sector.
The company offers ten different tools, the flagship is AudaPlus, the solution standard assessment of the grim for experts.
Y include cars, motorcycles, light industrial vehicles and heavy.
Apart from the cost of coins, it takes account of the time repair estimated by the manufacturer or the scale of paint.
The tool is buying itself by its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it less, to the maximum 10 times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which conducts thousands d’expertises, is negotiating a price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow full identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it is out of the assembly, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on the glasses, and AudaSubastas is a server opened the professional sector on the Internet that allows d’enchérir on vehicles declared wrecks.
The statistics service is very useful in identifying trends, analysis géo-démographiques or know the current problems by brand or model.
It is possible to investigate, for example, how much of a mark models determined went to the garage for a breakdown or how many have suffered serious losses for a given period.
Motive Gt is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It sells, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended to experts and provides digital images, as well as access to parts, price and official time of the manufacturer.
Motive Gt is a company of the group Einsa, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions evaluation of the sinister, breakdowns or maintenance devoiture.

Devis garage in four stages
With the tool Auda-Taller, the company Audatex ensures that l’usager received a quotation in only four stages: identify the vehicle, the parts, create a estimates and the generate.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince professionals older, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1 034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 off-roaders etc. 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and a connection to the Internet.
Once the model to repair identified through its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question is can we select the necessary piece.
L’utilisateur can include variables such as the price of the workforce, or of the cuts, then it can print the estimates for the customer.
AudaTaller is not a tool in its assessment as AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the intended to garages does not include the time of labour.
The cost of using this tool to the garage is 350 euros a year, which can be the subject of credit.
Currently, the company Audatex works for these images are in three dimensions.
It is an innovation that mechanics are a very good eye, it will, for example, select a door and turn to see the face.
