The skips sorting of waste are not the aroma in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort his drinks packaging, while in the villages of Moravia South you fall on skips sorting at every street corner.
And in Brno?
Here, it should be that you take several minutes before finding the skips.
I do not mean that we do not trierait no waste in Brno.
I have the impression that the councillors of our city, the second largest city, was not enough to this problem.
Brno in the stone age of the sorting of waste not only because the citizens can still sort that paper, glass and PVC, but especially given the number of skips dedicated to the waste.
Have you ever tried to lay a plastic bottle in the city centre?
This is a science, which requires above all the time and nerves of steel.
The only place that I found for the moment, this is the place of Moravia in face of Potrefena Husa.
What Mr Onderka and his colleagues do not want to, but it seems to me sacrément shortly.
Without talk about the fact that in other areas of the city it is not an easy task.
Thus in the end, many of my friends do not sort their waste.
The laziness.
It is a is actually going on to reach the skips.
It does not surprise me.
I myself, after a holiday, I have proposed to go lay a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except that I have found no drop of colour street Kounicova.
Fortunately I have found the right place to take the tram.
That said, the waste in overflowed.
That is, after all, the centre of Brno, which is supposed to represent the best the city, not? !
It is likely that ecology and so-called esthétisme are not too the Socialists in Brno.
They prefer to buy the city a first league hockey which is a disgrace to the city in the country, instead of buying a few additional skips and propose the sorting of more raw materials to a Brno.
I am pleased to be able to strengthen my impression with official statistics after dragged a time on the Internet.
According to the society EKO-KOM, Brno really is the worst of all the Moravia region of the South.
The budget of Paroubek has deprived of the argentaux pension and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the Government's view, the farmers or the staff there may lack the money for pensions, illness or savings housing.
but also for the interest on the debt of the State or the international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, the Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and the Communists, the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the Government would make borrowing costs, pensions or sick leave. ” It is that put the problems later, undermine the ground, " said Janota.
must know that on borrowed money interests to pay is higher and the return sooner or later.
The State has not actually the choice of where to draw the money.
If it is not reduced social aid or its spending, it will have to raise taxes.
To all those that the left has increased, firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And to their children.
The people will and should not fear for their pensions or insurance, including 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a greater debt of the State - next year it will not 163 billion in funds, but more.
Despite efforts by the Minister Janota debt is growing more quickly and with it, the costs associated with interest.
The State is going to need money for the repayer and it is more to slightly increase VAT or reduce the maternity leave the government in its package anti-déficit.
It will also miss five billion to complete construction of roads and railways because of the transfer money to a few groups of voters.
It is mainly what has already been decided and started that it is not possible to amend the projects to reduce the costs.
All the retain, which is not free.
This means delay or halt 30 major projects, and the removal of European funds is also in danger, according to the warning Karel Hanzelka, spokesman of the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to resolve the financial deficit very effectively - it will draw from the benefits of ČEZ) supplier and distributor of electrical energy (, that the State has in large part and contribute to the fund.
The concern is that the dividend is never certain and that it is in no case of a well without substance.
Last year, 18 billion that have been navigués since the ČEZ in the budget.
each year, dividends are used to pay the deletion of environmental damage, to complement the pensions or serve in the pension reform.
Furthermore, this gimmick is the real deficit budget of up to 5.7 per cent of GDP according to the rules of the EU.
And that is far from the end of Carnival transfers.
The budget for various compensation for victims of communism and crimes, and even savings housing, has fallen by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without the money.
It is a lottery.
If we lose a procedure, we must in any case the pay, Janota.
The Minister will then have to save the department or, at worst, reach the budgetary reserve of government.
It also cent million in cash for a two billion, which is expected to follow online what are the costs of each administration.
The first phase will start in January.
If the Finance Minister no money elsewhere, the project will have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone overcome two operating systems
In the future, Americans are a mobile phone that will allow the user to move from a system of exploitation to another pressing one button.
projects that have been proven seem promising.
It is a button and you go to Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility is the target of American society VMware, which deals primarily with the development of software virtualisation for computers.
We will enable you to manage two user profiles on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate in personal and professional
The two will operate in the same time, indicated Srinivas Krishnamurti society VMware in an interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was introduced in November last year and it has been made a first demonstration a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualisation on the smartphones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It is a Nokia N800 changed with a RAM memory of 128 MB, which served simultaneously systems Windows Mobile and Android mentioned.
The development of new technologies to mobile phones is booming.
Society VMware works with the American and European operators to test the virtualisation on the smartphones, and customers should have access to aircraft during 2012.
The lack of snow in mountain concerns the hotel
The tracks are deserted is not the issue that the operators of ski lifts.
The lack of snow dissuade people to book their holidays to ski in hotels and pensions.
, and it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in the winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have many visits on our website.
Internet users walk offers, asking prices, but did not commit to reserve for the moment.
And if they require, they immediately if there will be snow or mud at Christmas, " said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl. Info.
If spend New Year's Eve of his dreams to Špindlerův Mlýn, is much more reluctant to respond.
If we give priority to economies and that the quality of accommodation is that we try to wait a few days.
The hotel of Špindler offer to stay a week for the New Year.
I believe that they will try even a moment of the place, but they will make way for them and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free Chambers will soon decline, " said Jandura.
The tourism agency Ingtours of the two is also still beds of free for all periods of winter.
The week of Christmas us most at the moment, it is not completely sold.
It remains free, say, half of the chambers in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared a stays Christmas last minute cheaper, " said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The tourism agency of the two may also propose the New Year to Krkonoše, but there is less free places.
The first 14 days of February are equally well, stays hivernaux remaining sell medium.
This year, interest in the winter holidays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still not snow to Krkonoše.
The people expect it to get to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the overlap during the week, Christmas also will be complete, " think Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the hotel Horizont Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
It was an improvement of almost five per cent.
We have few places for the New Year as for Christmas.
There is great interest during the holidays January of Polish and February sells well too, " said Karel Rada, director of the best hotel of Pec.
The Omnia hotel near the parking lot central Jánské Lázně is also to 80 per cent during the period of the New Year.
On the contrary, half of the beds were empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already 60 per cent of occupation at the moment.
February is a little more low for now, but as soon as the snow will fall, interest in the Krkonoše grows still certainly indicated the director of the Omnia hotel, Erik Sporysch.
The hotel of Krkonoše must not, however, expect more snow.
Thursday, it will be more costs and rainfall, they should be neigeuses in the mountains.
but by the time to warm up, informed Jiří Jakubský station Hradec of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: iteration is the mother of wisdom
It becomes even comical, the hard effort with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of sage, the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, that he regarded himself as well.
When it eventually let leak doctrine ardently expected, it proved that he had recopiée paper from the Iraqi scenario of Bush of three years.
Not content to use in the text several times the expression " as in Iraq ", it has not hesitated to use the title of the speech, Bush's January 2007 as part of its own speech: “ A new road "
At the same time, he was personally criticised the idea of Bush to send new reinforcements in an Iraq burned out by the civil war as “ irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences. "
The following months have shown, however, that the Bush strategy, which was the recommendations of the commanders of campaigns, was the only possible and success that newspapers at the moment does not speak at all of Iraq.
This has not enhanced the reputation of Bush, it said, objectively speaking, he has left his successor a final position much more favorable could not hope.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
This is again the commanders of campaigns that have called for an increase of military contingent, including the commander of the operation in Afghanistan, the general Stanley McCristal, which even severely criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
It was 40 000 men in order to be able to make the situation more favorable.
The president has hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, at least it has defrauded the 10,000 soldiers.
to root out the promise of 5,000 more of Europe, even if it were on 10 000.
This is more problems in any strategy Obama seems to be its intention to withdraw the armies of Afghanistan by 18 months and complete the whole process within three years. Any doctrine of Obama brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt the fact that a half will bring the same fruits that progress in Iraq.
In spite of fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders to honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands by the exact opposite - we cannot rely on person and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, difficult to prepare for the Afghan security forces, accustomed to change leader during the day that suits them.
political institutions, although based, will be the eyes behind which will proliferate ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of various ethnic groups in light of the lack of clarity about the reports, which are further complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a “ quick to act ', which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of the strategy Obama was perplexed by it.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has worsened and is now on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and the reality can be confident that the small soldiers in the midst of war for their " prompt return to the house " will bring a real miracle.
From a political point of view, set a date for the withdrawal of troops is irresponsible because the Taliban will regard as the indirect admission of defeat.
The last summit of NATO has shown that the will of the Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is to negative.
The European policies do not know or do not want to explain to their constituents in which the Council in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can alter the situation dramatically is the development of events linked to Iran.
if the situation continues to deteriorate and strengthened sanctions have no impact on Iran, the American will face the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
It will respond by example when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Each solution of this type will, however, a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only rustine for Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for it is working on a new strategy, should it prove to be a flop.
The leaders of the bank Goldman Sachs will receive bonuses in cash
Employees leaders top of the US bank Goldman Sachs will receive this year of bonuses in cash.
The company announced in response to strong criticism over its pay practices.
The group of 30 major leaders will receive shares in lieu of money, that they could not sell within five years.
The actions can be withdrawn leaders if they take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs raises in leading the effort to link the pay with performance long-term on Wall Street.
I suppose that Wall Street is well aware of the sense that it should take, said the former banker investment Douglas Elliott of the society JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after being set aside almost $17 billion in premiums on the first three quarters this year.
For the current year, total premiums will probably exceed $20 billion in spite of the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the premiums of the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced Wednesday that it had a single tax of 50 per cent bankers ' bonuses over 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.

The minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus has invited in the Castle
The President Václav Klaus will on Friday morning, the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which reports its stay in government because of its disagreement with the State budget for next year as it was passed by the House of Deputies
On considers that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota the cabinet will be on the agenda of the meeting Friday.
Klaus also criticises the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which is widening the crisis of public finances.
This is the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed of the meeting.
Janota then discuss his office Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget which will be submitted to the signature of Klaus is a deficit of 163 billion that the Czech Republic should manage.
, however, the Chamber of Deputies approved on Wednesday the proposals of the left on money transfers and has increased the amount of officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government rejected the proposals of the Social Democrats that they would increase indirectly the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent dispute is born between left the Government, Klaus and the other, disagreement which calls into question the future of the cabinet of Fischer had been trained by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
The critics claim that the budget, as it was voted by Members, removes the package of savings measures by the government of Fischer and which must to stem the debt of the State.
Klaus, who may ratify the law on the state budget, but that there was nothing to do so, said today during a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, that the policies have long neglected the " serious problem " of the " weakness irréfrénable " of public finances.
At present there is, according to him, no solution in favour.
Only a strong government could contribute to an improvement, whether it was based on a consensus of the political parties, according to the president.
The President of the ODS Mirek Topolánek has indicated that the budget is staggering, and that the government should question its existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas told the ČTK that the idea of a cabinet administrative supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Greens is clearly more.
In its response, the Prime Minister Fischer called such words of " drastic verdicts ".
The head of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek has responded to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is appalling and it will exceed 200 billion kroner.
Wednesday, the ČSSD called the ratification of the State budget for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new film of Clint Eastwood
Despite criticism of the fact that major roles are played by actors in the US, South Africa claim that the new film of Hollywood Invictus - Invaincu will address the world much on the country, its fighting and its success.
The story is sport, relations between races and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, American actor rewarded the Oscars, embodies the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman said that it is a Mandela aged ninety-one years to embody it in the film.
Matt Damon played another important role.
I said to him: “ If I represent, I should be able to see you personally. .
The player aged 72 years was rewarded for a price for his role in the tragedy Milion Dollar Baby of Clint Eastwood in the middle of boxing has, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery become itself, a US president shadow, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone alive and also important to many people as Mandela.
The ex-homme of South African state has been imprisoned 27 years for his hard work for the end of apartheid in South Africa.
It was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning unbeaten and it is the title of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was speaking as him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the team of South African rugby François to unify the country. The President Mandela newly elected knows that his country resteencore and still divided racially and economically after apartheid.
It is sure to unite its people by sport and decided to join rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team will eventually move in World Cup in 1995.
Freeman has worked for a few years to bring the history of Mandela on screen.
I had no other purpose if not play this role, in order to bring most of the reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me it was safe to talk like him
The actor said that if he and the international political rights were in the same region, it would have tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, to be in scenes before his speech.
The more important for him was to shake his hand.
I realised that when you hand, I recover your energy, it is transmitted and I had the impression of how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon played in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national team of rugby in which a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh environment of rugby.
For him, her first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a surprise.
I remember when I come to the door of the house, I was opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was said: ' I look much more in the film ".
Despite the differences between the actors and models, Invictus under the leadership of the director Eastwood has received positive opinion and even ambitions for the Oscars.
The critique of films Todd McCarthy of the newspaper Daily Variety summarised his discretion in these words: “ It is a very good story, a film very well done. "
In evaluations of films on the site rottentomatoes, Invictus received 76 per cent positive feedback.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is strong: the Russian tested a rocket.
It has been a strange light phenomenon of unknown origin above Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence has recognized that yesterday have tested a intercontinental ballistic rocket near the Norwegian border.
The launch has still been a failure, and the missile “ Bulava " to be the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming the nightmare of generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His presence repeated during tests of the rocket has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
The most of the time, or Bulava did not boom, or it was damaged in full flight.
The Russian newspapers talk about " Bulava ” and “ missile that is not "
A missile, which is not is
The 13th test took place at the beginning.
It is that at the end of that again damage on the apparatus.
It is clearly the engine of the third stage of the rocket exploded.
This time, " Bulava ” was soaring nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij which travelled under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can rightly be set on fire in a boat in movement and immersed
That is why the mysterious light above the Norway caused by an unidentified flying object precisely is likely by a " Bulava " flawed.
, the Norwegian had no doubt that a Russian rocket.
The general argue that this time we cannot talk absolutely failure.
The first two stages of the rocket had resisted and damage affected only the third.
In previous cases, the drivers have been failures on the first floor.
Even if no test launches has past smoothly, the leadership of the Ministry of Defence considers that only six of 13 have been failures.
The success rate of almost 50 per cent fills, therefore, the general optimism and, therefore, always a “ Bulava " fly without problems and that it will take ten nuclear cores hypersoniques a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetissov signed to a one-year contract with the CSKA Moscow
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov is again in the professional game in 51 years.

Fetissov, which put an end to his career to 40 years in 1998, is currently the President of the CSKA.
After the injury of Denis Kuliash we urgently need a defender.
Fetissov is regularly and agreed to help the team.
We must still address some details on the form, said the coach of the club Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP.
There has not been clear whether the comeback of the legendary player of hockey will only one match.
I think that Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mental other players, said Nyemtchinov.

Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The direction of the Hyundai plant of Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent additional hours that the unions have declared a state of emergency strikes on Monday.
The spokesman Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai plant.
The direction does get agree with the unions on a Saturday worked this year.
We cannot renounce our plan of production, it is essential, that is why overtime volunteers have been proposed on Saturday, 19 December, knowing that there would be two teams, said Vaněk.
The site Sedmička 1605 indicated that the company has proposed a bonus 400 CZK to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will be awarded as a afterwards for the day worked on 28 November.
The society, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way to motivate employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for hours in, or they may pose a replacement leave on 28 December and extend their end of year holidays aindiqué Vaněk.
In addition all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for the costs of transport and for their lunch.
Given that overtime were the most urgent and hot in the comments and the demands of the trade unions and employees who have been spontaneously production last week, the management has taken the decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, said Vaněk.
Until last week, employees of the car plant were forced to work almost daily two overtime in more of their eight hours.
The unions are cancel the state of strike after signing of the agreement.
The following negotiations between the management and the unions must take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to end the strike rule in the case of an agreement on their claims and signature of a common document.
The situation in the plant culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 workers were on strike because of overtime.
They were protesting against the poor pay and alleged hazing.
The defended herself with the fact that employees should work as a supplement to fulfil the requirements of production of automobiles.
During the announcement of the strike Monday, the unions have also requested that the employees had ceased production are not subjected to any sanction.
The unions for the society to reduce the time spent in overtime.
Moreover, they want this year a reward of 5 million kroner) 209 euros (for them.
The car factory Hyundai of Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It has started production last year in November.
It has produced about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars a year.
Czech Découverte: a substance that operates on the HIV virus " hard-working people " also
A team of Czech and German scientists testing of new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it is also on the virus that have already developed an immunity to drugs.
This is, in some cases, head to the fact that the combination is not as hard on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the moment.
It may extend radically the life of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of HIV in the body.
Their consumption, however, entails a series of side effects.
Moreover the enforcement of this increase is responsible for the development of so-called resistant virus on which the drugs have more impact.
The Group of Experts three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination is blocking the development of the virus in a different way of all drugs used up to now and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
work researchers to discover new substances " improved ", on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their links on the protein of the virus.
The metalocarboranes have a single three-dimensional structure: two cages to multiple walls are trained by boron atoms of hydrogen and carbon and connected by a metal atoms, in this case cobalt.
A virus traitor and resilient.
The protease HIV is a protein of the HIV virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the protease HIV there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If we stop the protease HIV, it will also establish the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, explain the researchers in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the journal Science Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations of two pairs of cages) see table (are connected by a court organic link, which is then systematically.
A little smaller but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the protéases of HIV has been tested in pieces, as well as resistant varieties, obtained from patients infected with HIV.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on the clinical medicine, but it does not weaken versions resistant against which the current medicines are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with a unique mechanism of action and their other properties as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other amendments are therefore interesting combinations to consider more towards the development of effective medicines for HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the laboratory of structural biology of the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and the Institute of molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over the budget. The ODS is Fischer defends
The President of the ODS) Civic Democratic Party (, Mirek Topolánek has described as " staggering " the ratified budget for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The first minister called the ODS of drastic verdict.
It said take time to analyse.
The spokesperson of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the idea of a cabinet administrative supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party didn clearly more.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether ilprend to the Chamber of Deputies support on the minority that is to combat the growing deficit, or if he is to remain in office with the assistance of the left.
Nečas has warned that the positions of the ODS and social democrats in relation to the problems of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday, the budget for the year 2010, with the proposed changes to 12 billion included by the left.
The Chamber has increased the money for salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The grief of government to the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they increased indirectly the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion.
The ODS left the room before the vote, obeying the desire of the government as an amended budget is the least bad option as a budget.
Déception and unnecessary
The Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, the Prime Minister Jan Fischer has indicated that the Government will still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in case of ratification of the amendments, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota has made an appointment on Monday with the Prime Minister after its passage to the government:
It has indicated in the same time that he wondered whether he will remain in office.
Her disappointment about the negotiations on the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, which have imposed the change of the budget, have no place in government.
The Prime Minister should also make clear that it will resign if the House ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit as e.g. insurance, pensions, or the reform of the law on services.
Topolánek: ministers appointed by the ODS is not in question.
This is the head of government Fischer and the government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing, stressed Topolánek in a text from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries to TOP 09, which has voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decided to resign in the face of conducting a fight against the amount of public finance deficit, " it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority who is currently in the Chamber. "
That said, we should not expect the support and the tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought and it will be on the agenda then I will, said since the House to journalists, the Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected to government precisely by the Democrats.
The Prime Minister Fischer has soared in the afternoon for a discussion of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS came back at the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas stressed at the same time that the ODS probably would have voted Wednesday against the amended budget if it had not called for Democrats to allow the vote of the budget.
We do not have the sense to be orphans, it is no small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not been accusations by the President of the Party in the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have been lacking.
I already knew at the time I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a bolchévisation of the House and the destruction of everything that there were positive, reacted Topolánek in person.

Jančura will be defamation complaint against three chiefs of ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will file today defamation complaint against three prefects social democrats.
And specifically against Michal Hašek of the Moravia region of the South, against Radko Martínka region Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura indicated in Dvacet minut of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the attempt to exploit the regional railways in some regions.
All regions have, however, eventually sign long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three have attacked and that the fact the fines mouths, while only made an offer for what they wanted to themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the price of Czech Railways, which had been signed last week.
So we have to defend us.
It is in exchange for slander of the society Student Agency, said Jančura to Radiožurnál.
Similarly, it reported evidence that no region has taken in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
Hašek believes that the complaint from Mr Jančura is the result of its media spectacle that provides free publicity for its society and for himself.
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on other prefects to do the same.
I suppose that this will be the opportunity to show clearly that it is Mr Jančura handling public opinion and use of false and misleading arguments about the regional rail transport, said Hašek
Jančura has already informed last week that it will invest a few million in advertising that the negative approaches.
He has said to Radiožurnál he will campaign after Christmas and that it intends to resume after the New Year.
It reported that the campaign will target the corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura began its campaign after the regions have agreed to give the Czech Railways exploitation of rail links for about $150 billion kroner, without bidding.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to Jančura threats of a Member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if it does not cease, we could lose our licences bus.
It is presented as a Member of the ČSSD, I do not know who it is, but I will not say his name, said Jančura today to Radiožurnál.
The vaccine against pneumococcal vaccines will be free and voluntary
The vaccine against pneumococcal vaccines will overturn the old habits from January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Some already, saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free immunization against pneumococcal vaccines are.
The pharmaceutical institute is already the maximum price that will pay for health insurance.
The specialists are also clear in the process.
A new vaccination.
The free vaccines for children of August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be given free of charge against pneumococcal vaccines.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If began the vaccination last year or earlier, we will have to pay themselves following vaccination.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the third and the fifth month of the child.
The last year a quarter of families has vaccinated children against pneumococcal vaccines.
But parents pay 1600 crowns or more for a dose.
The vaccination of young people requires four doses.
specialists believe that each year the insurance spends 300 to 450,000 in doses of vaccine.
They save on medical care that the children vaccinated would require.
So far the State spends an estimated 500 million per year for any child immunization.
The vaccination repaid was introduced with the package Janota ”.
The pneumocoques are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to surveys in hospitals, there has until 28 deaths of children under the age of 10 years caused by infections of pneumocoques.
In the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the vaccination repaid.
The vaccination will be mandatory?
There is advice on a possible compulsory vaccination in the future.
From January, it should be resolved by insurance and optional.
For example, the chairman of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
His Association promotes long vaccination against pneumococcal vaccines.
At an international conference to which our association participated, have not been really pleased that we have a voluntary vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other side, we are pleased to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it is a direction that we must now follow said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not change the process of vaccination against pneumococcal vaccines.
We are absolutely not for the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, say doctors.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Society of paediatricians, acknowledged that a vaccine based on the volontariata its shortcomings.
If all the children were vaccinated, it might be a decline renewals of vaccinations, “ In the situation where the vaccine is such a sum I understand the decision making voluntary vaccination ", however, Cabrnochová.
The experts predict that next year, more than 80 per cent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
The vaccine against pneumococcal vaccines marks a break that this is the first vaccination, which is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explained that insurance should free up funds for the prevention, they conserving and possible future medical care.
The doctors will have to buy their products themselves
That, however, is linked to the concerns of paediatricians practitioners, related to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to make vaccines by insurance companies, doctors in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the State.
Members were concerned, however, that this would allow the assurances " from the amounts of insurance ".
Thus, doctors will need to buy products and expect the assurances their compensation.
The pediatricians will individually invest nearly 40 million per month in vaccines, which is a substantial sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a “ museum "

The Labour defends the tax increase.
Ministers have defended the increase in the tax and spending cuts announced in the report of pré-Budget, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories have said that Alistair Darling has failed " an opportunity to show that it was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing its decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor has also drawn the wrath by low wages and salaries means.
Among its main proposals, we can see an increase of 0.5 per cent of the Social Insurance and a ceiling of 1% on public wages from 2011.
The anger of the Insurance
The unions have protested that the low wages are penalised by a recession that they are not responsible and have warned that “ problems ” s'annonçaient.
The reduction of insurance — social which will produce about 3 billion GBP per year — has put the world in anger, because, according to him, it is a tax on jobs, while the aim should be a recovery of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than 20,000 GBP per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
ISSUES of the report PRE-BUDGET
The Insurance will further increase of 0.5 per cent from April 2011
The economy will encoreplus that 4.75 per cent expected this year
New tax of 50 per cent on bankers ' bonuses
The increase tax on the profits of the company for small companies has been abandoned
Rabais taxes electric cars and wind turbines
Increased pensions of 2.5 per cent
According to estimates of the Treasury, a 30,000 GBP will lose 90 GBP per year and a 40,000 GBP will lose GBP 190, while a 10,000 GBP per year will GBP 110.
Ministers have said that their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 entrainait " difficult decisions " but stressed the fact that 60% of the burden of additional taxes for the first 5 per cent of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, rejected an increase in the tax and stressed that a reduction in expenses was a " drop in the ocean " compared to what was necessary.
" These are important figures. They will halve the deficit, which will be absolutely necessary over the next four years ", he said to the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident and that the growth of the economy redémarrerait.
, however, the Labour forecasts for economic growth - which will affect the amount it will need to borrow and the speed with which the deficit will be closed - have been put in doubt after the Chancellor was forced to revise its initial figures.
In his address, he said that the economy would probably 4.75 per cent this year - far worse than the decline of 3.5 per cent predicted in April - then that the loan would be 3 billion GDP above the prior estimate.
" Need missed " '
Conservatives who will launch on Thursday a new advertising campaign warning against the " debt crisis " of Labour, said that the draft to borrow 789 billion of GBP over the next six years was not sustainable.
Ministers have not managed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they said, ignoring " callously " difficult choices until after the elections - which in June 2010.
” They have anything significant on what they were going to do, ” said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary to the Treasury in the shadow cabinet. ” They had the opportunity to do so and they have missed. "
" The major announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the victor. ”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour insists on the fact that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, contrary to the Tory proposals that would lead to a more rapid and more important the deficit.
But the Lib Dems affirmed that the money raised through increased taxes and lower spending would be used to support spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were " built on the wind. ”
Nick Robinson, Political Editor of the BBC, has said that the timing of announcements - such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits next April, mentioned ci-dessus- would leave the Chancellor face accusations of propaganda, the money is recovered the following year.
However, leLabour insists that additional assistance is provided while people in need and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
" Wrong budget "
Although ministers have not published details of expenses beyond 2011, economists have argued that it was clear that the restrictions on public spending will begin to be felt that in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies Studies Fiscales (said that the figures of the Chancellor, in the future, substantial cuts in many areas, including potentially the transport, education, science and defence.
" The pain is in fact that postponed ", said Director Robert Chote.
" The announcements the most important will be made after the elections, regardless of the victor, " said Roger Bootle, economic adviser to accountants Deloitte.
" This was a false report of pré-budget. The markets are well. ”

Amnesty condemns the " abuse " Iranian
last 20 years, human rights have been less respected than ever, according to the report of the association Amnesty International.
the report presents “ repetition of violations " by the regime, before and after the presidential election campaign in June.
A man cited in the report stated that he had been beaten and burnt with cigarettes. Another stated that he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism for its failure to respect human rights.
The authorities have said that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens have been killed in Iran, after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has led to more major public events since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
Dozens were sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors say that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the beginning of protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the detention centre Kahrizak.
since then, the authorities have tolerated no criticism, said our correspondent.
" False confession "
Amnesty International has documented case of a student in computer for 26 years, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Travailler with networks of Facebook and protested against the election results.
" They have often hit in the face ”, he was quoted.
" I was burnt with cigarettes, under the eyes, on the neck, in the head. .. They have threatened to execute and have humiliated. "
After five days, he signed a false confession and he was released and left in the street, still in blood and a half aware, said Amnesty.
In August, the losing candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others had been violated.
The Iranian authorities have denied the charges of rape, but admitted that the abuse had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who has said have been locked in a container with 75 other people, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty has accepted that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary created a committee to investigate the unrest post-élections and the response from the government, but it has affirmed that the mandate and the powers of these agencies were not clear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested, over the past three weeks ago, in order to prevent other events.

Islam may be French?
The pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the last book, " Why the French do not like the headscarf ”) 2006 (, a stylish and well documented on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today.
The latest book, Mr. Bowen has a much broader and more ambitious.
Bon anthropologist, it not only wishes to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutions that are now in France this great eloquence. Bozen calls “ Muslim areas " for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well listen and replicate the discussions between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
A Muslim should marry in a mosque or at the town hall) or two (?
The evolution and the rights of homosexuals should be taught to young Muslims?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim?
A Muslim can use a banking system based on the interests for a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, who are the daily lot, rather than the political concern to the media.
The author identifies a new generation of priests, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern, secular society.
They do not push the debate until the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts a Islam Sunni purist associated with Saudi Arabia's, are a small part of Muslims in Europe.
Mr. Bowen said that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can be reached with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how the French politicians) and the intellectual elite so virulent guardian of secularism (are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared with Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make historic compromises with the secular Republicanism.
Rather than an increasing pragmatism, it is a " narrow key values ”.
Islam may be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say ' yes, but not yet. ”
The view the darkest of the world
The Arctic change more quickly and more dramatic than any other place on the planet.
The ice that the compose is melting at an alarming rate, carrying with it a life cannot survive elsewhere.
The oil, gas, and fishing are in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In “ On a thin layer of ice ", Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrateur, painted a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
Connaisseur history and complicated policies of whaling, he described the long tradition of explorers of the Arctic, which were shown in chasing the polar bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous aspirant 14 years which had to fight to the tip of his musket-shape, is a myth, but the rest is true.
The young oursons, captured who were swimming with their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, a famous involved 75 ours.
Even today, the size of a zoo are still generally a millionth of the surface necessary for an adult. climate is rarely mentioned: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green because of algae which in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and is often on the threat posed by hunters on the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where hunters by helicopter and the Indians Inuit in motoski use fusilsd'assaut powerful to remove their game.
Ironically, it is in the north of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain as long.
In his new book, “ After the ice ", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, provides a clear and frightening summary of the science of the Arctic and an exciting overview of what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmosphéristes nor the marine scientists can tell exactly the speed of change.
This is not for lack of trying.
At nineteenth and early twentieth, travel pioneer of Fridtjof Nansen gave the initial information on the melting of the polar ice.
The submarines in the Cold War were then mapped the change of relief sous-celle-ci.
The surveillance satellites and probes on the icebergs are a great help, but most of the work is done by men hardened, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson, looking at the world special and tiny system depends on the Arctic ice, formed by the nets of brackish water pressure in freezing.
But the bear above the wonders microscopic contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the ice, between 2013 and 2050.

An American citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a US citizen who provides mobile phones and laptop computers in the country, have said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, working for Development Alternatives, Inc. , based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana trying to gain access to the detainee who has been arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under the law, a citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of " dangerous ".
All the supposedly revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and criticism, the risk of arrest.
The graffiti anti-governmental and speech are regarded as serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bloggers more, led by Yoani Sánchez, lead discussant People's writing often on the husband and she followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country receive rewards but permits have always been refused.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tension between the Communist government of brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration as a " soft " in order to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times, on Friday night.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government advance by practical steps, such as releasing political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, so that the United States to reciprocate.
The mobile phones and laptops are allowed to Cuba, even though consumer goods and new desired in a country or the average salary of an employee is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban Government has granted to the ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for text messages or for a conversation of 15 minutes a day.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often must submit their name to the government.
Access to many Web sites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few American jailed in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berbena, press officer to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said it could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are a big mistake.
activity which, in any other open society, would be allowed -- the free distribution of mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas programme of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently published a report severe on the freedoms in Cuba, called " New Castro, even Cuba ", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his elder brother.
According to Vivanco, a defendant is often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be policy and that the Cuban Government is often a negative reaction in the US, when the two countries are beginning to start a better dialogue.
The Pakistani authorities prevented a plot to send men in Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities have identified an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five men of Virginia North in Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that this would remove an important network of terrorist recruiters scouring the Internet in search of young men radicalized.
investigators have said that they were hunting a personality insurgente hidden, known as the Saifullah who invited these men in Pakistan after having discovered when one of them has commented approving the terrorist waves on the website YouTube video on the Internet.
arrived in Pakistan, these men have been guided by Saifullah who tried to help them to join the remote region of the tribal belt of Pakistan, the home of al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the secret services of Pakistan which was informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had not managed to convince the al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not involved in the plot of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Consequently, they have been isolated for days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the mountains prohibited in the north-east become a refuge of terrorism.
They have been regarded as undercover agents.
This is why they have been rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The authorities said that the men were determined and that they are still trying to obtain permits necessary to obtain entry in al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani forces of law.
The these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are interviewed by the FBI -- insistent on the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more important in the determination of the people in that trust.
since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the American secret service had priority to infiltrate men in the al-Qaeda network.
The recruiters organization play the role of gardes-barrières, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those that may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, the potential American recruits are studied closely by al-Qaeda.
but they are also very attractive for the group because of their potential access to American targets and their value propagandaire.
However Evan Kohlmann, expert from the Foundation NEFA based in the US, said that terrorist groups must also do more attention in recent years in the choice of the people they accept as the American secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow the model of recruitment that other people have already? said Kohlmann.
The model is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen for a “ action ” to the climate
tens of thousands of Protestant marched in the streets here Saturday, calling for a greater action on the part of the negotiators working in the halls of Congress Bella Convention Center of the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000, but 25 million estimated by the police.
This event was held relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists had lit a few explosives near a set of government buildings, in centre- city.
As little has happened during the discussions on the climate law by the United Nations, thousands of activists marched through the city, deploying banners in English saying ' every one is no planet B " and one in Spanish, saying, " The Earth said that it has enough ”.
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including the top model and photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the country home of his mother, Peru, has opened the eyes on divisive issues facing the country because of the impact of climate change that are already taking place. "
is one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march -- to get the word and appeal to the leaders of the world to take the right decisions, ambitious and engaged, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the demonstrators to come too close to the centre Bella and said that it had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they masks or that they were in possession of knives.
The police prevented the demonstrators to come too close to the centre Bella and said that it had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they masks or that they were in possession of knives.
According to a passer-by who asked to remain anonymous because of its involvement in discussions on the climate, the activists who were wearing masks and black clothing, sparked several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is surrounded by a handful of ministries.
They were almost buildings, he said, adding that they were first, followed by " a few big explosions ".
A within the Palace of Congress, people were gathered around TV screens to monitor throughout the afternoon.
But it appears that the protesters have failed to wake up the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, representative of China for the climate.
When asked if he thought that an event would have a positive impact on the international deliberations, he replied in English “ is something that I did not realise it.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying, " The event is important, I cannot hear what is happening outside. ”
It noted that the march could be helpful or harmful to the outlook.
It shows the public interest and the different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “ you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or affect the freedom of others. "
The results of tests reveal persistent differences between the races
The federal report last week on the mathematics results provided good news for public schools in Washington DC.
Although the District is still far behind the head facilities, the report shows that the Grade 4 and Grade 5) cm1-cm2 (are in much greater progress over the previous two years that in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what comes out of the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress) National Assessment of the progress of education (is the persistent gap between the performance of African American and white, both local and national.
The results means white children of Grade 4) CM1 (to WashingtonD. C. have increased during the past two years of 262 to 270) on a scale of 500, but those of their classmates African American women increased by only three points, 209 to 212.
The achievement gap has in fact increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8) 4th (remains generally steady, only a point, 245 to 244.
The result means white has not been included in the results of tests because the sample was not important enough.
The overview on a period of six years is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in class of Grade 4) CM1 (, when the first report NAEP District was published, was to 60 points) 262 to 202 (.
Although the results achieved by children in the two groups have increased during that period, the difference is only reduced to 58 points.
La last week, some defenders in the District have expressed concern that rising celebrated by the Director of group of schools Michelle A. Rhee and the local mayor, Adrian M. Fenty) Democrat (were propelled by the white students who were already good elements.
That would mean that we have the aggregate in the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a group non-profit stands for equality in education in the District.
I is not immediately evident joy for one or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown) related, Member of the Council of D.C. and whose daughter is in Grade 4, Eaton Elementary) elementary school (.
often critical of the management style of Rhee, Brown said that the message of the results of tests is that middle schools) colleges (of the city desperately need attention.
Really, you always see the positive signs and I respect that.
The fear is that we do not devote enough time and energy to our middle schools) colleges (.
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This autumn, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, Wilson Reading System, designed the school classes end of elementary school and early college, which had not incorporated the foundations of the reading earlier in their education and who are quite behind their peers.
Every day, the mathematics, to the Kindergarten) tongue (to Grade 6) 6th (focuses on the games and the experience of real life, as they have been put in place in the District by the former head Clifford Janey, which must also be credited to the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply believe that we must continue to work to provide better response to these students level lower than that of the class, said Rhee.
Others feel that the results of the NAEP pose the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of education at the University of Berkeley in California who studied the results of tests.
The conventional political solution is to spend your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest parts of Washington.
This targeting can have political consequences which this important programme.
But the problem, of course, as other Superintendant schools, it is trying to use the middle class white and black.
Our focus is to ensure the development of a system of good schools.
We must strengthen our schools districts in order that all families, regardless of the place of origin, be assured that their children will be able to obtain an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendant schools in Newark, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap of success étaitla duration of the traditional public school today to 180 days in the District of Washington, D.C., to be in competition with the Charter schools.
must obtain approximately 200 days to change, said Janey, which has come to an agreement with the union teachers last year to obtain 185 days, which it considers a “ starting point ” to obtain a further increase in the next contract.
Make the higher education a promise of future
The bus was arrested in Gettysburg College with a long sifflement.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years ago, in descend and cligne a moment of eyes at the sight of the white columns, brick facades and lawns green pastures.
The parents of Graciela had only able to finish high school, àEl Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, which was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
So, when she and other students of Grade 8) 4th (have explored Gettysburg where fees are of $38 690 per year, his attitude was less a new student impressed that enthusiastic.
Super is where I will consider! noted Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide the leading to the entrance of the building.
Youpi, really? she said food for thought when he noted the low ratio professor of law student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that were visiting children during their journey of discovery for three days and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university.
The question is where.
Although this issue is still widely for the large number of American children born to parents Hispanic immigrants who have left the school which have become parents to adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to the university education, which will enable them to enter the middle class.
In fact, " a Hispanic “ second generation ” on cinqpoursuit its high -- a significant achievement when you consider that so many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without having completed high school.
Their success is important, say researchers, they pave the way for future generations that will play an important role in the workforce of the country.
The researchers studying fighters claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
There are those whose parents set targets to their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
The mentoring programs also play a very important role to help Graciela and millions of children as it to reach the university -- in particular, if its efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, which has studied the Latin American students.
We must think to provide a support network for these children, until high school.
The federal programme, which funded the universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as the ERG UP) prépares you (, it provides more than $300 million a year of local schools to organize the programmes the university began when students of families on low incomes are in middle school) College (and continue until the end of years of high school.
since 1999, the programme has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent entrant to the university, according to the United States Department of Education.
The Ministry of Iraqi oil has agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty in the course of two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements made by the Ministry of Iraqi oil with the foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil industry to Iraq, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
The companies are left with participation in only two of 10 fields auctioned.
Seven companies had paid to attend the second auction that began Friday.
The only had an auction has lost.
Two companies have obtained contracts for the auction in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of US companies, were Asian and European societies paving the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the forum Iraq Oil Forum, a site for information on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
The concerns on the Council, supported by massive coordinated bombings Tuesday, and political instability as the American military troops withdrew have hampered the American companies, preventing them from entering with more force in Iraq, which has the third largest oil reserve gross of the world, say analysts.
The American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, in particular the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. , were the only companies to obtain contracts with the Ministry.
The American companies, the most important, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which had strong ties with the Ministry of Iraqi oil and provided their technical advice, left empty-handed.
The Russian companies, Lukoil and Gazprom were the two major shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, a more enchéri on contracts that other companies and is left with significant holdings in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be equal to its competitors and achieve its commitments in Iraq.
societies pré-sélectionnées to submit auctions have made offers which were then compared with the price per barrel as the Ministry agreed to pay to motivate the production above current levels for each.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaeda would have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that a US missile that struck along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of al-Qaeda operations this week, said Friday the United States authorities counter-intelligence.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles in their car, on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to sources in the United States and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities have said that the missiles had been fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA, in the lawless tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was struck, said a member of the secret services Pakistani civilians, speaking to the phone Miran Shah.
the authorities have stated that the local militant suspects fled into place and promptly confiscated what remained of " completely torn body ".
It was completely impossible to local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two American counter-terrorism officials have given evidence not specified that Somali was part of the dead.
Somali was described as one of the military organizers leaders of al-Qaeda who led the terrorist operations of the group out of the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Her role was to organize plots in the world, said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this was probably the conspiracies of attacks against the US and Europe.
It followed the instructions of al-Qaeda leaders and has translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority said that Somali had increased rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaida's and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It is perhaps not known to the public American, but that did not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important figure of al-Qaeda or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks carried out by CIA drones has declined since the summer, about six operations a month for two, according to the figures by the Long War Journal, a Web site tempered by a group non-profit.
The decline is perhaps due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have been reducing their vulnerability while killing also ruthlessly suspected informers, says the site.
The United Nations special envoy to Kabul withdrew
The United Nations special envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the presidential elections, supported by the United Nations.
The departure of Eide comes as the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers in Afghanistan.
envoy of the United Nations has said that it supported the increase but has expressed its concern regarding the timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and which other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, sending the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat has also urged the US and other military powers to increase the number of international staff assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase should be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not resign but that it would simply the commitment to his family, in March, to have only two years in Kabul.
It said that he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon knows now that he has time to find a replacement.
I simply said that it was better start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months from the start of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the United Nations, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
representatives argue that the name of Staffan de Mistura di was cited; it is a citizen Italo-Suisse recently chaired a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously headed the peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential elections and to conceal evidence of electoral fraud.
Eide has denied the allegations but said that the accusations of Galbraith -- which has been thanked -- " have damaged the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism as regards the international observation of éléctions ”.
Eide said that it had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate relief for US forces in Afghanistan.
It has also urged leaders of the United Nations to allow his successor to hire more staff from the US and other Western countries it is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence about how their money is spent.
Eide has expressed his frustration on the limits of power in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy regulations of the United Nations interfered with its opportunities to make new talent.
United Nations rules are such that I have been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It is disastrous, and it cannot continue.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would impose " significant additional sanctions " on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking at a forum of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a visit to a week in the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, a dédramatisé the possibility of military action against the Islamic republic.
There is no option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such an outcome. ¨
One of the things that I weigh more, is that if I learned one thing in Iraq over the last six years, it is the inherent unpredictable side in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions against the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the streets.
He stated that a “ motivations and punishment " may be needed to persuade the Iranian Government that it is actually less security with nuclear weapons " because " its people would énormément'.
Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined the leaders of Europe in a warning that Iran will face consequences " probable " if it does not reduce its nuclear programme in full compliance with the Security Council of the United Nations and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency) IAEA (.
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for peaceful purposes.
In the talks in Geneva on 1 October, it indicated that it would resume dialogue on its nuclear programme and agreed to abandon a substantial part of its stockpiles of enriched uranium, in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has prompted such an agreement, develop a confidence on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to be far away from attempts to agreement, in part, say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided on the fact to engage with the US.
Frankly, I think, the inflexibility of Iran in the face of some of the proposals of the international community in which they had in fact agreed in early October, has led the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, to join what they had not envisaged, in terms of important additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set 31 December deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before it turns to other options, including the continuation of this that the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “ increased sanctions ".
In a statement Thursday in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations has denounced what it called " unfounded allegations " of some members of the Security Council on nuclear activities in Iran and said it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, " in order to achieve a satisfactory solution in the long term ”.
Gates, who had to return to Washington late on Friday, met with the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the rich oil region of Kurdish to derencontrer leaders of Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
tensions persist between the Kurds and the majority in Iraq, particularly on the borders, property rights and the sharing of income.
Gates has urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid all delays of US plans to reduce the number of American troops, 115 000 to 50 000 by the end of August.
Gates would also ease the anxiety of the Kurds on the withdrawal outstanding. The United States authorities have quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: " We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq ”.
We will not abandon you. ”
In China, ageing, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband have grown up surrounded poster of propaganda the lecturing, “ The Mother Earth is too tired to host more children ” and “ A baby in, it is a fall more. "
They have taught the lesson that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the low rate of birth of their city and the ageing of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and have begun to encourage young couples to have more of a child; their response has been strong and instant: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
There is no second, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources, which has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of children unique stayed with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed the " small emperor ”, a crisis of the population threat the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, although it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over will shoot up, 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent by 2050. This figure is well above the global average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal city with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 per cent of people registered in Shanghai residents, while the birth rate was less of a child by a couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission Population Municipale of Shanghai and Family Planning (said that the fertile couples should have babies to ' help to reduce the proportion of the ageing population and to prevent a shortage of in the future ”.
Shanghai is on the verge of becoming “ too old - but not as rich, however — that the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden ”, she said.
A gradual reduction
Prepared in the country's constitution in 1978, China's policy is to this day, without doubt, the obligation, the most controversial introduced by the Communist government.
couples who transgress this policy may have to pay huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the countries to avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while the lawyers of human rights have condemned the abuse in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced women pregnant with a second child to have abortions.
Moreover, many couples have used selective abortion, leading to a ratio of boys, girls abnormally high.
In recent years, authorities have gradually softened their stance on the policy of the child.
In 2004, they have given more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of towns, the members of ethnic minorities and the circumstances in which men and women are already unique children -- and in 2007, they have softened many of their slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research Institute for Research on the population, at Peking University, said that the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if a partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai has become the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage.
In no time, the posters urging families to one child have been replaced by copies of regulations retailer that has the right to have a second child and how to leave.
The Government of the city has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples, in their home, and slipping leaflets in their backyard.
It has also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
The disappointing
Although officials in a rural town in the suburbs of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples seeking a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district has reported that there was no change.
The common Huinan, with a population of 115,000 people, for example, is still only four to five requests per month.
The Shanghai officials, frustrated, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still only about 165,000 -- slightly higher in 2009, but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Committee of family planning in Caolu of Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason that many people do not want to have more children.
They want to fill in their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, have said they adoreraient have two children and that they are legally allowed.
But like many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life assurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The Western consider that the one-child policy is a problem, said Yang, an engineer in which the woman is seven months pregnant the first child of the couple.
It is true, it is robbing us the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
This is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their reluctance.
Wang, human resources, said that it wanted a single child because it was a itself. ” We were the centre of the family and used that everyone is. "
We are not used to take care of someone else, and we want to take care of others. ”
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a translation company said it more bluntly.
For couples working two, middle class, which reduces the birth rate, he said, must be selfish pourbien succeed.
The people of 20 or 30 years have grown up watching their parents fight for the first time China capitalist and do not want to have themselves this lifestyle, he says.
Even one child asked a lot of time of his parents, he says.
A mother should give up at least two years of social life.
Then there are problems of space -- " It you must change your apartment -- and planning -- " When your child has only 9 months, you need to write his CV for a place in the best. "
Most of his friends are ready to that experience again, said Chen, but not both.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We do not want to do too much sacrifice.
The United Nations group a draft plans for the reduction of emissions.
The conference on climate, sponsored by the United Nations -- which so far by the disrupted and mutual recrimination -- came under the spotlight Friday, because of the publication of a document outlining the ambitious reductions of greenhouse gas in the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations support most of the burden in the next time.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, stressed the remaining obstacles, it has informed the path to take.
But it was seen as an important breakthrough in the negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 leaders of the world coming next week in Copenhagen.
drafted by a special working group, the text does not say how rich countries give the poor to withstand global warming, and long term.
And it offers a broad range of options on key issues, including how the developed and emerging economies would reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature that those responsible would be prepared to tolerate.
It gives a great flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, Representative àWashington the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has written six pages of the document, considered a text of 180 pages to concentrate on what has described the Secretary-General Executive on climate change to the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, as “ full ”.
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations reduce their collective emissions in 2020, 25 to 45 per cent from 1990 levels, while the main developing countries, during the same period, would reduce emissions by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, the country would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years to help the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal clashes occurred, which have dominated the negotiations last week.
Todd Stern, the United States Representative to the climate negotiations has rejected any discussion that the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by industrialized countries, compared with voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed countries.
This is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming more to China that the Bush administration has been two years ago.
The US will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of major developing countries, said Stern, who also expressed regret that the text does not focus enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern has made his comments one hour after the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs, He Yafei has said that the chief US negotiator, or lack of “ common sense ”, was " highly irresponsible " for having said earlier in the week that the US would not financially China to combat global warming.
With the economic future of major world powers, defects have emerged within the developing world and among the world industrial and emerging economies.
The battle is more the rescue of individual economies that the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States acrimony on their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozens of the most influential countries are scientific need to act more boldly.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting about who should bear the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters accountable for their actions.
It really is a game in which developed a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who is also Adviser on the climate for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of those countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put pressure to get them legally, in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that the negotiations will at least a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small States peoples which brings together the 43 members, has drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Chief of the climate unit of the European Commission, said that the action of small island States has " put political pressure on the political process ”, in part by what they are now unified and demand in emerging economies such as China and India, to act.
debates have become a matter of urgency, when delegates focused on the fact that they should solve most of the issues pending before the Heads of Governments come to an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Minister of Environment, Jairam Ramesh and Deputy Minister Chinese took to the air and rushed to the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings behind closed doors and conferences of information, in order to make claims that will be discussed during the following week.
The image of gathering -- in which 13 000 people come in and out of the Palais des congress every day -- activists guitar players entertainment night making fun of countries to reveal that the proposals are submitted and distributed on paper rather than emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is on the increase: almost all key ministers are here and not later on Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the big, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the global policy of Conservation International.

In Britain the first train to 225 km/h will redefine the syndrome Monday
A 5h13, Monday morning, a whistle percera night to signal the start of a train that will mark a revolution in Britain.
The first commuter train to the country to 225 km/h, when it filera of Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes in the first commuter train Javelin outside London.
He hoped that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of reliable and fast trains and will connect major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
Small lost holes will become commuter towns, periods of business travel will be long and the passage of the aircraft and the car at the train will reduce the emission of carbon, while reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties associated with this project.
But the ten billion needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of risks to the environment may curb high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two) HS2 (, a company set up in January to achieve for the Government a feasibility report, will make his report to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will enable it to get a detailed map of the route of the next phase for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn up within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres of the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 has three options for a high-speed network, to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a configuration Y for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line is separate in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch to the west Pennines àManchester and Scotland and another to the north-east, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will run through Scotland.
" It seems that this will be the best option performance' said a professional of the railways.
When completed, the time of travel between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with a trip to an hour now.
The proposals will train travel to 400km/h, making the UK the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains 400m long and can carry 1100 people.
Until 18 trains per hour can operate on a line London, Birmingham.
A terminal for 20 passengers per hour would be necessary.
In the space constraints, it is anticipated that existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
The experts rail industry say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he feels that the project should be put in place, but the more lengthy public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if the machine, the network will be built part by party.
The trains would primarily be forced to drive out of high-speed lines on the existing track north of Birmingham, retaining journey times between London and Scotland more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure a planes to trains, as a point of reference for the revolution of the railways.
The taxpayers repay the loan of 75,000 GBP for the orangerie of Tory
Alan Duncan, the main Member of Parliament Tory, made to pay the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of a orangerie that it has built in his house in his constituency.

It had been authorized to pay the interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month to the taxpayer.
The authorities of the Commons have received complaints at the time and have not been interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, which control of members ’ expenses. The last night, Mr Duncan said that complaints could be " clearer or more simple ”.
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, is the owner of a house in two floors in a village of Rutland - Melton.
The neighbouring houses have been sold for almost £ 1 million.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and dining room, but the emoluments said that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
last year, he added a véranda at home, describing, in its plans as a orangeraie.
The neighbours described it as a " véranda pleasure ".
has not been asked Mr Duncan to give an explanation for the increase borrowing during a recent investigation made by the Committee on Privileges and standards of the Commons, on its provisions for loans.
The Committee has cleared last month of any accusation of non-compliance with the rules, after an investigation on its expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan has changed the legal security of the loan of 271.406 GBP ownership of London at the house in his constituency that he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan claimed approximately 1400 GBP per month of borrowing interests until March last year.
In April, its applications have increased by more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on the loan RBS Mr Duncan has not been changed at that time, suggesting that all increases in order to fund the borrowing of 75,000 GBP.
The interest rate standard variable RBS rose from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year without change since then.
The latest publication of the Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to ask 1 250 GBP in May.
Mr Duncan has lost its position, the shadow cabinet in September, after a journalist in the supposedly filmed stating that the members of the parliament should survive " on budget " after the scandal.
" In fact, it is now national, you have to live " on budget " and you are treated as “ the m…e "
He said: “ I spent my money in my garden and I asked for a small part, based on what was correct.
and I would have been able to seek sacrément more, but I did not do. ”
The member of parliament, millionaire since his former post as a trader in oil, has begun to have to explain its spending, in May, after it emerged that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the office of the costs " could be considered excessive ”.
A activist has dug a hole in the form of £ in the lawn of Duncan M, to protest after it was revealed that he had asked 4,000 GBP for three years.
when asked about the increase in borrowing, last night, Mr Duncan said: " It was for capital improvements, approved by both the costs and Legg. ”
He added: “ There is no problem of evasion or of development and use of rules or anything.
It was quite clear in the rules permitted, etc.
This could not be clearer or more simple. ”

The association UDF increase the tone and the New Centre to use the acronym
The association UDF, controlled by the MoDem party of François Bayrou, responded Friday to attempted takeover of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, the acronym for the ex-parti giscardien, which is no longer use on any support, under penalty of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced its intention to recover the UDF, finding that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his legacy after having reached out to the left.
The defense minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of CN.
To support his approach, he has received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette) ex-UMP past the NC (claiming ownership of the UDF for having been the first to file in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday evening, the office of the association UDF, controlled by friends of François Bayrou which will not be depriving, is his silence to launch a formal notice to the Minister and to the honourable Member, requiring them to no longer use the acronym and to transfer ownership of the brand, under threat of prosecution.
You have multiplied in recent days, indicating that you were going to offer your political movement of +reprendre+ the UDF, writing the association in a letter signed by 19 of 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Mrs de Sarnez of MoDem party, as well as Senator John Arthuis Alliance.
You have also seen fit to follow on your equipment and activist on the front page of your site, the name of this movement, the +Nouveau centre+, the slogan +l'UDF of aujourd'hui+, also see the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use the acronym, said the office of the UDF which met the NC to withdraw " immediately the mention of the name of the UDF any support and that of) its (website ".
It also calls on Mr Hervé de Charette " to transmit the property of) the (marks its legitimate ”.
If you are not, the courts would take to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, prevent the signatories.
In mail, they indicate that the UDF " is a political movement in full since 1978 " and recalled that Mr. Morin and his friends had " choice " to leave in 2007 " to create a movement competitor, as others have done in 2002, to create the UMP ”.
The New centre has therefore, no right to use the acronym UDF) Union for French democracy (.
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its accession to the MoDem party for three years and the establishment of an office to defend " the material and moral interests " of the training by Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing.
On Hervé de Charette, the bureau, " when he established the ", it was “ more adherent of the UDF for three years, but in the UMP.
It is scandalous and fraudulently of the abscence deposit of the acronym UDF for the conduct.
This brutality is being transformed into crime, denounce, prior to mock, on the strategy of the NC: " It seems that in politics, as in life, it is more fit to make a name for himself that to try to break out of anonymity taking fraudulently a name which has not right ”.
The Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided Friday to try the artist François-Marie Banier to determine if, as is the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, it has benefited from a weak state of the 80-year-old to deprive them of a part of his fortune.
The photographer for 62 years, known for its photos of stars, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years ' imprisonment and 375.000 euros fine.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the families of France, in which mother and daughter are in taking the reins of the empire of L 'Oreal cosmetics.
But the 15th criminal court has ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87 years, should be carried out collectively by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L 'Oreal has always refused to submit to such a review, not in the conditions proposed by the Office of Nanterre during the investigation.
The designated doctors Friday should submit a report by 10 March 2010 in saying whether Liliane Bettencourt could be weak and time periods.
I think it is.
I am going to talk, said outside the hearing the lawyer of Ms. Bettencourt, Mr. Georges Kiejman.
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Mr. Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the court.
This is excellent news. The expertise will show that he) Mr Banier (has manipulated the elderly lady that must be protected, he said.
For two years, the daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has started criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist touche-à-tout, that it accuses of having benefited during the years of the weakness of his mother to obtain a billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance or tables of teachers.
The Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, as a friend.
While the court should examine the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, oral arguments lawyers have sometimes turned to naming family on Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt reported three letters sent by her) in 1999, 2003 and 2005 (to the notary, in which it said was wary of her husband Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: " could you explain to my daughter, I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years.
Françoise, I have never been able to talk to him since his marriage. ”
For its part, the Office of Nanterre has again felt that the complainant was not admissible to act, particularly as a judge of guardianship refused the last few days right to request to open a process of judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt " a full capacity, it is not under protection and a guardian.
No one has to act in its place, ” said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court has decided that it would take action once the trial will be held on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Revolution managerial or end of intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of big French companies, our fight for the economic development of intelligence has been vain…
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of big business to its employees, said the position of the companies to consumers before the revolution marketing: it is to join the staff to " values " determined to high as it was once, to impose the consumer products designed by plant technicians.
In the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has handed over the strategies of conquest of markets where. .. although the authoritarian temptation to products with the factors preferences of customers return regularly!
A demobilization employees can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon which particularly affects the frameworks.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of the intellectual of the company, including R& D and, more importantly, of economic intelligence.
Indeed, l’IE ” requires of all stakeholders) ... (a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision ”; it requires by employees a commitment that the authoritarian management revenues are completely.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would be the staff at the centre of the company on the same basis as the client.
It all on investigations of internal
The opinion surveys internal –comme questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salariés- will encourage them to this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I am afraid not.
- firstly because I have seen that, faced with a new situation, any structure is finally, after much detours, to prioritairement… what it has always done. !
- secondly because authoritarianism –une pathologies of the pouvoir- increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
Among the major schools engineers, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They, by intellectual comfort, the old theory behavioriste, revived by the " neuroscience " American and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the research institutes and the media.
For example, suggesting that it is possible to use the " levers ") sic (of the commitment of managers, a recent survey d’Ipsos published in Le Figaro. reinforces the leaders in a position of mechanistic governance, not for today ’ s world.
Identifying and measure factors mobilization
On the contrary, managerial revolution is necessary for the proper functioning of modern business, to adopt a final vision of human behaviour.
It is to include, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, the commitment to the company is possible only if it is clear as a means of achieving their dreams, their ambitions of their projects.
Currently only the studies issues of l’Analyse motifonctionnelle adopt this approach motivations.
These studies have shown that they consider their company based on a doxa predetermined that through their image seen company, to assess what it offers to their projects of life.
The identification and the extent of these factors, the business leaders can control, and anticipate their “ social performance " and put their management of human resources ” to the ".
They create a breeding ground for joint development of robust economic intelligence and effective.
Speech Oslo: " just war " is praise to right to Obama
The American right welcomed Friday, the speech the day before in Oslo by Barack Obama, pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of " just war " against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives, who had brocardé award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, the former candidate for the vice-presidency of the elections in 2008.
I liked what he said, Mrs Palin, égérie of the right wing of the Republican Party, the newspaper USA Today, adding that itself raised the issue of war ” sometimes necessary " in his memoirs that have just been published.
The war is, of course, the last thing in my view that the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
It must stop these terrorists all there, she said.
Mr. Obama, who inherited two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday to Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, estimated that the president had done in Oslo " good job ".
I found that the speech was very well, welcomed the former Speaker of the House of Representatives which has particularly the reference to “ the existence of evil in the world ” in the presidential.
For some side, I found this quite historic speech, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed in the radio programme " The Takeaway ”.
The former elected, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said it was pleased to have seen " a President of the left " to remind members of the Nobel Committee " whether they would not be free and could put a price if the use of force did not exist ”.
For Michael Gerson, a former plume of George W. Bush converted columnist for the Washington Post, Mr. Obama delivered " a very American. ”
In addition to appear in " citizen of the world ” as it always does ”, “ he talked as an American president, recalling the Europeans " whether they live in a bubble of security that they have not established and that they do little to preserve ", said Mr. Gerson.
Among the rare right not to be convinced, a hawk in the Bush era, the former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, has called the speech " dull, ampoulé and without inspiration " on the site National Review Online.
A left the president, Democrat Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When is the war in the concept of justice, it is easy to justify the killing of innocent people, he warned.
The press centre-left remained flattering to the President.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, has described his address of " superproduction " even for a speaker, known for his talent.
The speech Oslo " should serve as a road map to guide decisions against the conflict, poverty and oppression ", has inflamed the California daily.
Mr. Obama " delivered the speech he was ”, the New York Times, deeming it “ both dark and inspiring ”.
Road: three marathons for an agreement which is the supply of Christmas
After three meetings of marathon negotiation process, the unions of the road sector and TLF, only employers ' organisation to be remained to the end, arrived Friday evening in an agreement that puts an end to the strike and the threat to the supply of Christmas.
At the meeting of signatures on Friday evening, the Secretary of State, Dominique Bussereau, was " pleased " that agreement, after several sessions of negotiations, which began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions the negotiators were left in the morning on Friday, with the hope of signing quickly in the late morning the text of agreement.
And even if three employers ' organizations) FNTR, Unostra, OTRE (had slammed the door.
But it took another six hours of meeting began to 11H00 so that everyone is in agreement and to 18H00 the text to be signed.
The conflict " would have been very damaging to business ” and “ it was feared that it would disrupt the Christmas years ”, said Mr Bussereau.
The text provides for a wage increase of 4 per cent for the lowest wages) in road transport, local and regional (and 2.9 per cent for the highest) international (.
In hourly rate, for the bas-salaires, " is 8.72 euros to 9.06.
This is not very much, but it is very far, explained Patrice Clos) FO (.
This is on will give the order to our activists that there is no blockages, not the blockade of centres of supplies.
But we can always have a few holdouts who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, chairman of TLF, hailed " a good agreement ”, although it was " difficult to grant increases on the top earners in view of the international competition ”.
According to him, the increases will be of the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the most senior.
This is the understanding of common sense and the respect of employees, said Dumont Maxime) CFDT (, while Thierry Douine) CFTC (has welcomed " a historic agreement ”.
Richard Jaubert) CGT (referred to " an acceptable compromise. "
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel expenses of 3% , and the general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, including addressing the issue of a 13th month and modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that “ a reduction of EUR 100 million of charges employers " has been the subject of a Government amendment to the Finance Bill corrigendum for 2009, voted Thursday night to Friday by the National Assembly.
The Government will ask the Senate to vote " in the same ".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement applies in a first time companies belonging to the organization, and a second time, to the profession, in case of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be " as soon as possible ", Mr Bussereau.
The opposition of employers ' organisations may only delay the process.
FNTR denounced a “ fool ”, because the EUR 100 million had already been promised to the sector to offset a portion of the carbon tax. "
The Secretary d? state transport forced us to negotiate in emergency? , not in conclusion? d a shared analysis, but to avoid antagonizing the eating turkey of the next Eve, lamented the Unostra.
For the Otre, the agreement risk ” of digging the grave, a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months ”.
A RER: disruption this weekend, trade unions unhappy about the proposals of the RATP
The disruption on the RER A, the largest online transport of France, will continue over the weekend, while a meeting Friday on the second day of strike between unions and management of the RATP left on their hunger as to their request.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchases before Christmas, there will be the trains between 10H00 and 20H00, a train on two of the central section) between La Défense and Nation (and a train on four outside the central section.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will require passengers to change.
The Galeries Lafayette, who expect 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that " the authority to make efforts to reach stores ”.
The RER A traverse from west to east Greater Paris.
The section RATP short of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.

Thus in the morning, Saint-Germain-en-Laye) Baccalaureat (was much less crowded than usual, including the absence of middle and high school students.
A Boissy-Saint-Léger) Val-de-Marne (, Jack Nbakina, engineer for 29 years, explained to be lifted " a half hour earlier, to be sure to arrive on time ".
The station Saint-Lazare had not known of saturation, indicated the SNCF, which had planned a senior officers and police.
The A RER made by SNCF, to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the station Saint-Lazare to join the subways.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held Saturday and Sunday, which will discuss the results, " meagre " by the trade unions, a meeting with the direction Friday afternoon.
The director of RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, career etc.
This is not what the drivers, who are demanding a bonus, Thierry Garon) South (.
The RATP met its premium proposals in parentheses, has outraged the CGT, stressing that the leadership was “ not kaput to resolve a problem while in the road and the SNCF is made ".
A further meeting is planned Monday for " a broader review of conditions from the profession ", said the RATP.
What was also say to the unions that the “ scoffed users weekend ".
In the morning, about 150 drivers had invaded a committee at headquarters in Paris.
That is when the leadership, which was previously any discussion during the strike, had suggested " in an effort to restore calm " the meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen the RER B Tuesday, after filing a notice by Unsa and Independents.
Trade unions demand a premium of 120 euros) Unsa (to EUR 150 30 euros variables) CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents (and complain about the conditions of work on this line at million daily passengers.
The RER drivers, all in the second part of career, are 980 or 2, 000 to 2.700 gross euros and 600 to 650 euros of premiums, staggered schedules, Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish court dissolved the pro-Kurdish, far-reaching decision
The Turkish Constitutional Court has ruled Friday the dissolution of the main pro-Kurdish, a decision that was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision may complicate the task of the government, which is to reach out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a democratic society) DTP (has been dissolved because it had become a " home of harmful activities to the independence of the State and its indivisible ", said to the press, the President of the Court Hasim Killiç, at the end of four days of deliberations.
The decision was made unanimously of the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven was required for the dissolution, said Mr. Killiç, adding that 37 of party leaders, including President Ahmet Türk and the Member Aysel Tugluk, are banned from politics for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation of the treasury assets of the party.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament) on 550 (.
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that the Members leave Parliament rather than serve as Members without label.
The decision followed a process launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuse the DTP to obey the " guidelines " of the Kurdistan Workers Party) PKK (, considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the window legal policy rebels of the PKK.
The party is, however, that it has “ no organic ties " with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court comes as the government has to reach out to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to dry up the support of Kurds in the PKK and end the conflict.
leaders of the DTP claimed that a dissolution could lead to increased tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan has degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
From the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered at the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the great city of south-east populated in the majority of Kurds.
forces have fired tear gas and used water cannons, while protesters were throwing Molotov cocktails and stones, with slingshots.
About 100 people demonstrated also in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk said that the decision of the Justice would " deepen the despair ”.
Turkey cannot resolve this issue) Kurdish ndlr (prohibiting a party, he said to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of parties.
This will solve nothing, said the Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This is a total torpedoing of the democratic opening launched by the government, commented on the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
On can expect, of course, reaction of the PKK, he added.
Thursday, the PKK has claimed responsibility for an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The first snow falling into
This that Wolfgang Brauburger, it is a good winter.
But the manager of clear and sablage roads) FES (clearly stated that this is not to annoy people.
It is simply so that officials can test the vehicle technology and learn the control.
And from the métérologues, this may well be for this week end.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles is ready to tackle the snow and ice.
The FES follows a plan.
Mr. Brauburger explained that as soon as it is to neiger on the city of Frankfurt and night-time temperatures below zero, large vehicles sablage walk 20 major routes) known as A routes (.
This includes the streets to great movement, the main arteries, as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
also included the firefighters access, transport routes, the pedestrian areas and streets in slope as the Atzelbergstraße.
Members of the FES start their service to three hours of the morning.
In case of need, the 1040 kilometres of roads should be salt with a basis that is, in 3 hours.
That is why the FES begins to h the morning so that the roads are released when will the trafficking of daily migration ".
Where it is becoming more difficult, is when the snow is to à7h30.
This causes problems, says the manager of clear and sablage roads " because no driver is willing to let the salt ".
Secondly, snow plus, addressing access roads and feeder roads - as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The avenues and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger knows that it has still a few complaints.
A five hours of the morning, pedestrian team of FES begins to reach the areas deemed to be dangerous and passages.
As for bike lanes, the services of the FES are generally not.
Mr. Brauburger said that there was in Frankfurt service spécialqui monitored the bridge between 22heures and 4h30.
As the ice to form very quickly on these surfaces, the vehicles of salt involved as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
It is also that the police to the special service encas needed.
The cradle of dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae like other carnivorous dinosaurs: this bipède was about 2 feet long for 1.50m, its members later were powerful, his head lying was with sharp teeth and recourbées, his short arms correspondence clutches in sickle and had a long tail.
If this case had lived a few million years later, it would have been exceptional.
But, as reported Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and his colleagues in the magazine Science on Thursday, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological features.
The animal was 215 million years ago in New Mexico that faisaità time part of the land surface of the supercontinent, the Pangée and towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt said that the discovery of the Tawa sheds light on a day the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, it tells us something about the relationship, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
It is in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt has excavations in the company of other paléontologues on the site of Gohst Ranch in northern New Mexico
Randall Irmis Museum of History Naturelle Utah and member of the excavation team told that they were sometimes find a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer of Trias.
Scientists have quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The searches have updated the remains of five.
A discovery that confirms the theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers have called the name of Tawa after word of the Indian Hopi for the god of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is a highly unusual discovery: the fossil of dinosaurs from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of bone incomplete.
All the experts in paleontology do not share that enthusiasm.
For example Sander Martin of the University of Bonn is not that this discovery is particularly dramatic, he said, however, it allows us to confirm some theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the present state of knowledge, the dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most fossil veterans, however, are fragmented and incomplete which makes it very difficult, the classification of the earliest dinosaurs.
experts wonder to what time the sauriens were divided into three groups of major developments: the théropodes) finger (, which includes the tyrannosaure and the vélociraptor emerged and which are the birds, the sauropodes, quadrupedal animals in the long neck, and those who are related and the herbivores ornithischiens including species such as the triceratops and the stégosaure.
According to studies of Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first théropodes.
This case presents an interesting report features both primitive and developed, said S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found indications that the Tawa hallae possèdait small air bags in its bones at the level of the skull, as the birds that are the descendants of théropodes.
These small pockets of air facilitate the breathing of birds in relation to mammals.
It seems that among the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially met.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest théropodes with small air bags in its bones.
As the related line of immense sauropodes had also air bags and a slight, their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As dinosaurs the most primitive known lived in South America, researchers have concluded that the sauriens had occurred there.
Therefore, the three main lines of evolution was divided and was from South America to the rest of the world is to say all the land which formed the supercontinent Pangée.
That appears to be confirmed by the fact that the team paléontologues has also discovered the remains of two other théropodes which are not related.
The three species can come to a common ancestor that would have migrated, researchers.
Alan Turner of the Museum of History Naturelle of New York and co-author of the magazine Science Studies said that there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
Of course there are a few contradictions.
Martin Sander, paléontologue in Bonn, said that there was a case yet, the silesaure, who was living in Poland today and which belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him that could give a distorted view because it has South America a large number of fossils of dinosaurs that have been preserved while there is virtually no on other continents.
, however, how dinosaurs are they managed to become the tétrapodes dominant of secondary era while ilsprovenaient a collateral relatively rare branch of reptiles, remains a mystery.
A time of Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the current crocodiles and with many other sauriens.
Towards the end of the Trias dinosaurs were all over the world promoting the development of many new species, while others, who were related, have disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassique.
Such success is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander is two hypotheses.
There may have been a mass extinction to which the dinosaurs survived randomly, while other reptiles.
Or then, dinosaurs were better and they have been able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favorisal'épanouissement of a group of animals which had also developed during the Trias and since that time Having in the shadows: it was the mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories of the world.

The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
cannot make enough the scale of the project Stuttgart 21.
For its supporters this is nothing less than " new heart of Europe ”.
If. S21, it is more that burying a railway station, more than a massive construction project which will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, in a hopeless chaos of sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 1980s.
The head stations, with the process that correspondence in the city, had a reputation at the time to be relics of transport of the 19th century that were effect of low-noise brake rail traffic modern because it was once much time to get back locomotives to forward.
Arrival, short, departure – that is what to do.
That is why stations, head of line must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart, too: a station of trains, which is at the half-way stage on the Magistrale Transeuropéenne rail between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava with the slogan “ heart of Europe ”.
The project S21 will really start, although the visions of the 1980s are more long compatible with reality.
Even planners ambitious acknowledged that the cost to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
fact, stations, head of line no longer pose real problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with pieces and voiture-pilote at both ends.
However is now the achievement of 21 Stuttgart next to the new line inter-city in Ulm.
The regional policies and communal prevailed.
The railways is to the party because it is the taxpayer that is the risk of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public.
's point of view urban planning the project is relatively well.
The urban space which – according to the charts planners generated by computer – will be very verdoyant.
For the system of rail transport S21 is harmful.
The station and the enlargement of the section are designed for trafficking of persons on attributed - and this is typical of the 1980s — an enormous growth.
A time there was not yet competition from cheap flights.
policy of modern traffic should first concentrate on strengthening the traffic of goods for transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not to freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the draft Schwaben.
That is the official figure.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain in the next decade this money will be for other nodes and congestion in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport mentioned in all six major projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section across the Rhine valley of 180 km.
Since 1987, the line is built.
It would be really urgent support here on the fungus.
But the project S21 made a low-noise braking.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck of freight traffic, and this in the heart of Europe.
The Government will consider the judgement on the airport
In Parliament regional Wiesbaden, the Land government raised the possibility of appeal to the judgement of the Administrative Court of Hesse on the prohibition of air of night flights.
The Minister of Economics Dieter Posch) FDP (announced that the coalition CDU/FDP commissioned experts to review the legal point of view the judgement by the Administrative Tribunal and is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Court of Kassel was justified in a written document that should adapt the regulation concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case or the proposed construction of the aterrissage north-west of Frankfurt airport would be.
The authorization to attérir for 17 aircraft between 11 and 5.00, as envisaged in the Land government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against air pollution at night.
The coalition must be decided on 4 January if it wishes to make an appeal against the judgement.
The critical opposition this time and trying to put pressure on the government representative for that celui-cirenonce to appeal to the Federal Administrative Leipzig.
The head of the parliamentary group SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise before the elections and to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be condidéré as a total failure to a floor.
It is sacrément difficult to be allowed to keep its word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir in referring to the slogan éléctoral FDP “ We wish our promises ".
The Minister Dieter Posch denies the accusations of Schäfer-Gümbel who claims that the Land government attempts to authorize the night flights using " d'avocasserie and roublardises ”.
It takes time to conduct a legal review.
The coalition does not take decisions on the basis of a “ first impression early ”.
The decision is legally reliable, said Stefan Müller) PDF (.
The interpretation of the opposition on the part on the prohibition of night flights is completely érronée.
US banks repay the aid
The big US banks, very affected by the crisis, have taken away their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion) more than 30 billion euros (for aid under the rescue plan Tarp.
The chain of American television CNBC reported in a news report that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
The banking institutions attempt to get rid of restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of, for example the restriction of bonuses awarded to the leader and the rules of higher costs.
The Bank of Americaa launched an increase of capital through the sale of securities to investors that he earned $19 billion of new money.
The rest of the sum comes from the coffers of the bank which are met through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the Director General of the Bank of America held to thank the American taxpayers: the injection of capital has helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had alleged in buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup is also considering the money on the financial markets in order to free themselves from the state.
The United States bank could launch as early as Thursday, a capital increase of $20 billion, was the clear CNBC citing the banking community.
The Citigroup spokesman did not wish to comment on this information.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the funds they had received.
Election accelerated
Finally it is past faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current tenant of the post of redacteur chief Nikolaus Brender by the Governing Council of the clear German ZDF, the successor is appointed.
The committee wanted to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the Berlin drafting of ZDF was the odds-on favorite.
The chain has not wanted to confirm - officially, the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
, however, it seems that there was also the will to do no harm more due to the ZDF Markus Schächter if the proposal was not accepted by the Council.
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, need the vote of 9 to 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known to the end of this.
two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Council to extend for five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender but this was rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council expressed support for the continuation of Brender and 7 others had voted against the dismissal by vote of Brender represented a failure while predictable Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU majority in the Council of Administration had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not wanting to extend Brender to his post.
It is Roland Koch, the words Hesse which had organized a league against the editor.
It had denied that the contract of the esteemed redacteur chief is extended, citing the fact that the rate of listening to the news of the ZDF had declined in Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, denouncing the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
A end even 35 experts in public law that had intruded in the debate, and that the action of Koch was unconstitutional.
But it is lost.
Peter Frey, who is it?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 to Bingen.

Grand cleaning in the university
Successful partial to the students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory, at a meeting between ministers and delegates of the Conference of Presidents, an agreement has been developed that the working conditions of students Bachelor or Master needed to be improved.
In the future, students should be able to overcome their studies.
They are put to accordpour lighten the burden of reviews: a single review is to close the study.
Moreover, the burden of work will have to be reconsidée to ensure " realistic and acceptable proportions ”.
The political authorities and institutions of higher education to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder also committed themselves to hold common structural requirements more flexible for the Bachelor and Master.
at regional level, there should be no different regulation of a Land to the other.
Less than reviews
Since the beginning of student protests last June, the Minister of Education and the Presidents of universities have constantly expression. " étudiabilité ”.
But for the first time, seems to take a practical meaning.
The Accreditation Council decided to significantly reduce the number of reviews: " Each module should normally be concluded by a single consideration ”, in a document of 30 pages on the future conditions for admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, President of the Accreditation Council said that reducing significantly the burden of reviews should be able to stop the excesses, which thus significantly in the étudiabilité.
The " étudiabilité " should be, in future, the litmus test of the organization.
Modules tout as the substance should be considered carefully to see if we cannot avoid this sensation choking in the sometimes in the choice.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID in Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg) CSU (is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should " have the opportunity and the flexibility necessary to enable and encourage personal initiative ".
The new regulations will access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted to the existing cycles.
These cycles should be " réaccrédités " every five years, which means that it is only by 2015 that all cycles have been considered.
10 agencies accreditation organizations throughout the country who depend on the Accreditation Council established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes are not too and the regime reviews not too strict.
In some states, universities and colleges specialized have already agreed with their regional ministries to take the appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only Land to have agreed to give more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities should organize tutorielset strengthen the offices of educational guidance as well as offices and service of international relations
The Länder and the universities provide a budget of EUR 10 million.
in early 2010, the Government wishes to submit to Parliament an amendment to the law on the institutions of higher education.
Following this there will be no more make one consideration to close its studies.
The studies will have to be more flexible, more must be guaranteed the recognition of notes other institutions of higher education and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, " étudiabilité ” of all academic cycles will be considered.
last Thursday, the government and the opposition have again discussed the issue of conditions in the country.
The décisionsont been appreciated but criticisms have been heard.
The President of the Federal union Socialist students reported that the organisation of education policy is more in the future " behind the closed doors " of Ministers and the other universities.
In later after the strike, the students as people should be able to speak a little.
The future diplomés higher education received the support of the President of the delegates of the Conference of Presidents) 1991 (Margret Wintermantel: what students is very useful, " she said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education Ministers with which the 1991 is working on a joint project of reform.
For the union of Education and Science) GEW (decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It seeks the right and opportunity for each Bachelor graduate with a degree.
Andreas Keller member of the steering committee of GEW request that the Länder provide students Bachelor of today, tomorrow there will be enough places for studies in Master and conditions of studies as good as possible.
The Länder must hire more lecturers.
The Education Ministers have not raised the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
is by the words " Arrival in Germany and is beautiful, almost more control. .. ” that a poet Werner Söllner, in which he thématise in snatches of sentences, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who won freedom but lost in the same time its territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 to Banat in Romania, was first Professor d’allemand and d’anglais in Bucharest and, subsequently, director of collection in a publishing house for youth before heading to Frankfurt.
Söllner received different literary prizes; in 1993, it was the highly coveted poetry of Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 it is director of the forum of literature of Hesse to the artist Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
did much of him in not literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was " The German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files ".
visibly upset and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his colleagues writers germano-roumains as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer he had worked as a qu’informateur police policy Securitate.
Söllner received in 1989, the price of the German language together with some of the participants.
The tests d’enrôlement had started insidiously in 1971.
I am, Söllner " is someone who has not sufficiently able to resist auxessais intimidation of the Securitate. ”
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter) Walter (.
Almost simultaneously with l’honoration of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its literary conflict copies with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, in a case which clearly shows the abyss and the low level of a political system based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can say according to current knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim.
In its own record Securitate, IM Walter has played a role, provides specialist literature Michael Merkel after the confession of Söllner and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter, who had intervened in its favour.
" It was able to draw all the difficult situations at the time ", according to Markel.
Merkel has felt the need moralde to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner fit his statement and to the public was unexpected, however admission of a former dissident collaboration with the Romanian secret services is, in fact, not so surprising.
Germany is a reservation for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper Die Zeit ”, after reading the 914 pages of its own record.
One can assume that victims be speculation and will sometimes guessed what real names were hiding last names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
In contrast to Germany, where between the consultation of the Stasi was a credible process, the attitude to the legacy of the files of the Securitate is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been constantly frustrated and slowed in the past.
It is that in 1999 that a National Council for the institution Birthler was established to work to the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate) CNSAS (but the return of files a rather dragged since.
There is since 2005, a law that defines the management of the archives.
What influence former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very high, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar which, following the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, said in a trés dismissive to the winner.
It had a psychosis, and ultimately on had questioned only once.
L’infamie power expected to speak here, without any gene, under the pretext of freedom of expression.
While many inevitable questions are associated with the case Söllner as so often happens in a context of guilt hidden.
Why now? has been stolen? The weighted auditors, admission of Söllner, offered hope that the result of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge that accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of l’oeuvre of Herta Müller, who was yesterday received the Nobel Peace Prize, is more than a footnote.
Tumultes to the Champions League
On had the impression that he was there, spruce from any right of a nice Christmas celebrations, on which the manufacturer sportswear had spread its goods when the new coach VFB Christian Gross monta at midnight the quarter in a Mercedes C Class, that he had just called a plastic bag orange supplier.
The rights, including the skull chauve attracted attention, allowed himself to lead in the city that it was yet.
In our 50-year-old could take the wheel – it had not been drinking alcohol and it was not drunk with happiness.
He spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow it was back to work.
For it is now that it would start.
words Switzerland that we had to take three days earlier were clear: " We have reached the final eighth ”, that is to say in the league champions thanks to our 3:1 Unirea Urziceni Romania " but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by the success. It will be a brutal struggle for not fall ”.
The " great work " we attend Sunday.
Here, it is to repeat in Mainz the results of the league champions.
And overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three goals summary of Marica) 5 (, Träsch) 8 (and Pogrebnyak) 11. (
Drawing the sort
The eighth final of the Champions League) match go 16/17. + 23/24/February return match 9/10. + 16/17 March (will be drawn on 18 December to Nyon.
The joy of the entry into service fulminante the successor of Babbel was moderate.
And the joy was not moderate only among those who had brought luck, who forwarded to Stuttgart destabilized, motivated and the pleasure of play.
I see the players and I told them they should focus on their strengths, I advised to be more courageous, explained the " plumber souls " – Gross - the recipe for success that sounded if bienmais, which no longer effects with the soigneur Babbel.
It triggered a certain magic, did doctors Jens Lehmann - in favour of Babbel -- ” in the foot when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that we would never have thought possible ".
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of pause for injury, it argued as the best player through its dynamism, tried to describe the " phenomenon " by a proverbial " wind " and the working method of the new leader: " It is someone who takes action and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation ".
But apparently Babbel had failed.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the course, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart are in need of tenacity.
Just as Gross, the players and the manager carefully overvalue victory against a defence completely outdated and weakened to Romania.
They had also won in Glasgow before four days later a bad awakening to Leverkusen with 0: 4, objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, signala they had achieved one of the goals of the season but there were others who were still far.
We have not passed the difficult course.
What Heldt on the day of his 40th anniversary was not the heart to the festival, even after the first victory at home for three months, is of the events of the weekend a television interview the goalkeeper Jens Lehmann fit rebound just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that other and not Jens, affecting Heldt, in response to the criticism of Lehmann.
It had accused the direction of style and said it had decided to change coach under pressure from fans pubertaires.
Lehmann had seen also as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele that day of free after the matches has been deleted.
Statements of Lehmann was " a pure selfishness " ground Heldt and announced the consequences for the goalkeeper.
They might become a friends for life these two quadragénaires.
In any cast, they agreed for the rest, that is to say that without the work of group trainer replaced, the sports and combative would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants have been " largely in the success " rétorquèrent Heldt and Lehmann together – and even the plastic bag rights acquiesça.

The case of Kunduz
frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the Parliamentary Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Ministry of Defence Guttenberg lies in the case of the Kunduz.
The SPD parties and The Left) die Left (called on the Chancellor explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After a review of the latest information on the air strike in Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg) CSU (for délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The Minister has intentionally, " an untruth " on the deadly strike two tankers in September, said the head of the Parliamentary Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the information of the clear ARD " Tagesschau ”) the newspaper 20h (.
Clearly, this means that it lied.
The to kill has been given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force security in Afghanistan) ISAF (.
That is, in essence, the content of the report before NATO and which was read by Mr. Guttenberg, said Trittin.
last Friday, according to new media revelations, the objective of lafrappe was in reality, not to destroy the stolen trucks, but much to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the investigation report of NATO, 142 people were killed or injured in the attack American air that was launched at the request of the German Col. Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left have requested Saturday, Chancellor Angela Merkel) CDU (, to take action as soon as possible before the federal Parliament and reveal that Guttenberg was really on the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast believe that Mrs Angela Merkel must be clear if the strategy of targeted killing policy Afghan government fédéralet if the chancery, army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects such criticism.

Saturday, votes were for express doutesquant the real reasons the referral of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to the information of the newspaper SPIEGEL, the information they had handed over to Guttenberg on the attack of tankers were both accurate and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the report of NATO and hid the Minister some awkward details.
In the entourage of two senior officials suggest, however, that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
The " Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung " reports that Wichert would have meanwhile asked in a letter a clarification of the facts.

The worlds of dream
Some see any awake, images and intend to vote that no one else is or will.
It is not only among mental patients, or the effect of the drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality are.
Until they manifest themselves during sleep, everything is going very well.
When we are lying in our bedrooms clouded, we can engage unfettered access to the dreams and the fantasies wildest.
however, awake, experience of dream, hear and see things that others do not see, has the reputation in the Western world to be mad or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices are not that mental illness or under the effects of the drugs.
That is our imagination that is in question: is the neuronale which allows us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, but sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream, madness and the reality to disappear.
A state of alert aware, taking the form of a dream, may be in various forms, in the best case we call that visions, the worst of the madness.
even if the trigger and the differ, visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the Prophet of New Age Carlos Castañeda, the latter of chamanes, psychosis and hallucinations are due to process very similar.
Il y a hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmettrices brain - first the dopamine, the norepinephrine, serotonin and l’achétylcholine - breaks down and that the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
The complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often for a schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of attraction land has more power.
Since l’antiquité, philosophers and doctors have always focused on the relationship between the madness and the dream.
For Aristotle, the hallucinations were a form of rêve-éveillé; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, found in 1861 “ great resemblance between the madness and the dream ”, to Sigmund Freud dream was " a scare with all irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that the composed ”.
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into in a comic strip.
His body is in two dimensions to the glaring colours.
L’attraction land has more power on his plane tsunami of the ceiling.
It is a coup.
Behind the creatures on earth ailées, grimaçantes, the bloodied, showing its teeth.
They continue to give the legs with heavy boots bold, the cast against the walls, it feels pain throughout the body.
Some thundering, evil, rant, walls and radio.
It can no longer the bear those voices that l’insultent and l’humilient.
Henning T. around two cables of the chain stéréo, in fact a loop and l’attache to a hook attached to the ceiling.
It is on a baffle and the loop around the neck.
It is clear.
The loop stands out.
Whether you serve lesson shout the voice in a chorus to extract the Rupture. “ Go in a clinic and am good care! "
Today Henning T. 40 years ago, he lived six psychosis, the last date of 2, the first of 20 years ago.
It was triggered by the LSD.
The diagnosis: psychosis schizo-affective, paranoid, in addition, it is maniaco-dépressif, it takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
During the psychosis I had terrible fear and despair.
The illusions are a cruel reality.
A% of the population suffers at least once in his life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics is the most common illness after the Depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, people can no longer make the difference between the internal and the outside world, they find themselves in a state d’hyper excitement, which are they may suffer d’hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – who, that comment or dialogue.
The optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The person cannot distinguish between the important and l’insignifiant, the brain can no longer filter stress signals, the aware is drowned in the sensations.
Like the dream, the hype is locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies issue deeper layers of conscience.
The perception of reality in the psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry at the National University Hospital in Heidelberg) Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum (.
The schizophrenic is in the centre of the situation, meaning focused on him.
At the same time it in a passive role, it is like a dream, overcome by the events and may not act on them in it.
That is why schizophrenic often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust the reality, the illusions are a harsh reality, wake up.
To experience once in his life a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, " the sensory structure and the reality is seen during the psychosis, is fundamentally retained ".
The thoughts and delusional hallucinations are based on the reality, the alienation of experienced a place in a real framework.
Why should our brain is this kind of speaking., is still a mystery to scientists.
The exceptional situations can lead people to lose temporarily the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the only factors.
Researchers assume that the persons concerned are petty brain damage.
assumed that the maturation neuronale brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example, by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, said Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained, is the way in which the anomaly of the system neuronal occurs and the fact that it is not for many years.
The environmental factors also play a role – the stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, if there is susceptibility.
Similarly the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on the neurotransmitters.
When our brains heating.
This is crazy, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck is that the psychotic to suffer delusions and expensive drugs for defeat while others buy expensive drugs for.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a question.
Kasten brings together for ten years on the hallucinations and the phenomena of illusory images: last year he published his results in a book entitled " The unreal world in our head. "
The hallucinations form part of the phenomena typical of psychosis, but also an impressive number of many other diseases.
On among them mental disorders such as borderline or depression but also the migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer ’ s or head injuries.
It is surprising that in certain conditions even the brains of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten consist of fragments of memories that normally has been withdrawn.
They take form in the areas of the brain dealing with sensory perceptions, are hyperactives or not enough refrénées; when our brains fuel but also when there is lack of stimulation.
The drugs can trigger this state like a brain injury or a psychosis.
but also the lack of stimulus, stress, the sorrows of love or other mental states.
In recent studies, a third of participants recognized have made at least once in his life experience a hallucination.
In 2005 Sarah K. 16 years ago, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and it is going to high school.
A young girl on normal.
If there were not the images and voices.
During the break, a young boy, thin, long hair châtain, the floor.
When it said his comrades watch it surprised – no one else is or will this boy.
They believe that this girl timid is a rêveuse lunatic but Sarah K do not dream, it is certain.
It is drawn, and the boy as it is and the girl who is sitting next to it on the bench.
It can even see its presence temporarily.
is a pleasant sensation, she found that young sympathetic.
Am I mad? , wondered t it sometimes.
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real, and they are going to disappear again.
The night appearances are, in general, frightening.
Often the visions are cumbersome.
When it is in class, it can complete the course because the professor is just in presenting a new pupil in his eyes and ears when it is invisible to others and that the professor is clearly attempting to explain the equations to the table.
The night appearances are, in general, frightening.
when, in the dark of the chamber, it expected the sleep that too little and too late, it often cannot make the distinction if it is drawn or dream already, if the images to see the faces grimaçants or the girl with cuts sanguinolentes on the arms and legs before his eyes open or closed.
Let me quiet, Cree t to these creatures.
It is not nor her parents and friends, they took to a mad.
Autumn 2009 Sarah K. now has 20 years ago.
It has had its trough last year and she lives with his friend.
A year ago hallucinations ceased.
Since it entered into by internet contact with the psychologist Kasten it knows very well that it is not mad.
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough incentives, the likelihood is great as hallucinations after a certain time.
I suppose that the brain is not enough, that we have the leadership.
Sarah K., single girl, fear of the other children when it was small and often played alone.
The hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years, that rights it called Daddy, since it was in age, was not his real father.
The same brain areas that are active in the acoustic and visual hallucinations, and for the impressions and noise, it is very difficult for people like Sarah K of the difference between the illusion and reality ”. Each experience ", according to Kasten " a place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images in the brain, which is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten, the night dreams are also a form d’hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenic, the mentally healthy person is able to recognise that the fantasies are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises its patients to cherish the hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is a step between the dream and l’hallucination.
In our world too focused on the conscience has, unfortunately, quickly to the imaginary experiences for diseases, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and medical director of the psychiatric clinic and psychotherapy of hospital Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious disease, painful, but which also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the so-called experience form oniroïde, a particular form of the modification of the conscience being stirred by the dream.
The experienced oniroïdes are semi-rêves very complex are seen as genuine by those who live and that it can differentiate the dream even when he is in.
The conscience oniroïde occurs during a trauma or in situations of extreme conditions as for patients polyradiculopathie which fully aware, have a paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of itself and the world, due to a sustainable and total inability to move, it replaces the real situation that affects his life by its own imaginary world which is divorced from reality.
That is a state of mental limit between the dream and l’hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of a place, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
is in fact a form of means and interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, an organisation that is given to men, not to sink into the void of the loss of consciousness.
This is real even later in the memory.
The Zurichois Peter Classen Cornelius, historian of art also describes his experiences oniroïdes in his book ' change of heart " as safeguard action of the soul.
It has 49 years ago, at a time when his aware for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body was sentenced to stand still in intensive care.
Claussen plunges in a world that has created, visit foreign travel in time. It is old man bed in a sanatorium, a robot in the room while on his health.
It is the average age of noble producing drugs blood.
It is removed by a Greek riding motorcycles that l’emmène in his country, he surfing with his hospital bed in the névé of the Alps and a mafia.
It s’absorbe completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memory.
According to Claussen these domestic voyages are basically any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he wrote in describing what he has lived.
On the contrary of dreams, the memories from travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
can say that they are much more and more intensive than the real experience.
Much of this lived ignited the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, the delusions oniroïdes, psychosis, hallucinations and experiences psychédéliques show us how our representations of external reality are fragile even in.
Any change to the state of consciousness, summarized the psychologist Kasten " can lead to a distortion of what we call the reality. ”
experience that can also be quite enriching.

Mazda3 i-Stop: A sportsmanship sustainable
Mazda will prove that the spirit of sport is not angry with respect for the environment.
To that end, it has to take on the Mazda3 the warrant system and start of the engine, called i-Stop, a device which, at least for now, is available on the engine 2.0 petrol 150 horses.
The second generation of Mazda3 s’illustre good note that it has obtained in its entirety.
The details, finishing the vehicle, l’habitabilité, behaviour, mechanics, the system i-Stop…
All these aspects are outstanding on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it appears that the seats fronts are an ergonomic and a excellent.
The reach of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
By continuing with the whole of the table and console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese to create an internal futuristic design, with many buttons and controls, as well as the bright colours in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 that the Civic, Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, wants to overtake.
By continuing with l’habitacle, this compact Japanese car this housing more than sufficient for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
There, a large boot to the process.
The warrant system and start-up automatic engine, at least for now, is available on the gasoline engine of two litres and 150 horses and with manual change of six speeds.
This is a true happiness. It s’illustre by his wit, his low noise, its benefits and control of its consumption.
In effect, although the Mazda3 demand are the diesel models, those who are not a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its ease of speed that for consumption.
On the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sports, in other words with the largest number of series.
Among the equipment, it change) RVM (which removes the death, the strength and stability, the regulator, the internal photo-epilepsy, the computer on a large screen size, the parking sensors, air conditioning, the rain sensor and light, the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio, as well as the alignment of 17 inches, are particularly remarkable.
Moreover, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the Pack Premium which, for EUR 1 500 more, includes, among other elements of adaptive headlights bi-xénon and an audio system BOSE with shipper of discs.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It s’illustre in particular by the quality of the materials used, by its conduct and its level of equipment.
Moreover, those who are not many miles per year can opt for the version i-Stop associated only the gasoline engine 2.0 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which lies between 21 770 euros for finishing Luxury and 23 270 euros for the tested model, the Sports.
In return for this significant sum, the Mazda3 we will each day a large dose of satisfaction.
" First " luxury
L. A. covers the red carpet of sensualité embodied by Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever blinded, dressed models as elegant as sexys for the exit of Nine. ) Photos: Gtresonline (.
Our " Pe ”, as sophisticated qu’habituée, opted for a " lady ".
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to watch his e-mail, without the possibility of even see some type of enclosures or surf the Internet.
It used its five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine the act as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see in the streets, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Contrary to the Smartphones, Peek offers a price and a very low monthly subscription, less than half of what it costs, for example, l’abonnement data of l’iPhone.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service data to life for six times more than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of invention and its third incarnation.
It is also limited the grand-frère American, but with a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those travelling with a Smartphone already know what the data when you cross a border or desperately cafeteria on the WiFi) or a connection of Fon (to consult his mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and for a long time it should operate.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but I, I would have made a PhD in physics for the understanding and good glasses to read the small print.
The reminders to the repeated the European Commission to offer affordable roaming tariffs in the whole of Europe have had a barely discernible.
On the outside of his native country, hesitating to use the data, and it was not wrong.
journalist light aircraft such as the FonPeek) it is always curious that it is Fon when it does not have the WiFi (offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are starting to think differently and studying various proposals to make their network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other research on the Internet.
Without subscription and without soup.
It is a connected device and it pays in his purchase and not every month.
And that is what I hope to see a day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with access to life as Peek proposed already in the United States.
I do not want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I would simply because I believe that is more just for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The colour preferred Michelle
The yellow is, without doubt, the favourite colour of the first lady of the United States.
If it went to the inauguration of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a robe and a coat of this colour, it has, in effect, chosen the same to accompany it in the second time, without doubt, the most important of his life: the Oslo the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama was wearing a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to the colour ressemblante, a yellow drawing towards green with brilliant reflections, twice, consisted of three parts: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same tissues, and was unsure of great embroidery or a necklace.
If although a first glance, it would appear that the first lady of the United States follows the trail of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to deliver the same.
But the fabric in which have done the two sets is very different.
If for office was a embroidering thick, however, it was in Oslo a velvet printed.
The materials also are different: green shoes to heel for the first opportunity, and a similar model, but golden, this time around.
The hairdressing also has changed: the hair are now reported then that it was released.
75% of working mothers have had problems professionals because of their maternity
The discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of young people who want to be mothers.
that reveals the “ Fertility and career women in Spain ”, carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with l’Instituto of Women.
inquiry, carried out on 9 737 women 15 to 75 years, leaves no room for doubt: 75 per cent of working mothers have seen their careers limited because of motherhood.
study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, if the woman is working or not and the type of employment.
Those who did not work outside the home, part-time work or have a little stable work, are earlier, have their first pregnancy as soon as possible and have more children.
In contrast, women with a stable job, mainly in the public sector, postponing the entry in the relationship and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years old with a fixed have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after having installed as a couple. This increases to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. ” These data show that women with a stable job needed more time in their lives for, which has led to the postponement of union and the arrival of the children.
Moreover, the type of job exercised influence widely, but at least the beginning ”, said the researchers of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that is widening the gap of the age of marriage for women and their first child.
According to the investigation, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child.
The difference is also among the women of the same generation.
For example, in the group that between 35 and 49 years old, those who have made basic and higher education have been mothers, for the first time 25.1 and 32 years on average.
" Another disctinction is also among the women, according to their level of education.
While those who have studied basic marry and have their first child before finding a stable employment, those with average or above reverse this programme and to give priority to achieve a stable work as a prerequisite to marriage and the arrival of a child ", said Mrs Delgado.
Diane Kruger also applies

A cowardly attack
last week, my mother, which has about 70 years, was walking in our neighbourhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent beside it and our dog, a sang-mélé, saved the APS and are weighing more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they assenèrent two legs that grew the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is great because we do not see what is d’amusant to attack a free small animal without defence which, moreover, was leaves.
must add to this the indignation of a woman strolling calmly and which, when it injuria these individuals, came to fear for his physical integrity, since énergumène that attack an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an elderly man or, ultimately, any person lower.
L’épisode took place about 5 p.m. on a Tuesday as another, in an area usually quiet.
The dog has gémi throughout the day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint to the police station in the neighborhood even if we doubt that it serves, and not to touch the sensitivities, we want to just say that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
Indignation has led us to condemn this.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to find amusing to abuse a free defenceless animals which gives us affection, friendship and we would like.
We do not know where is the proper education and the respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for the use of helmets
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spaniard Foundation for Road Safety) Fesvial (, has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmets, especially among motorcyclists, as has been said today the two structures.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, since it is the only protection to avoid injuries to the head, or even death, in an accident on two wheels.
Michelin has indicated that the campaign had in line with its commitment to road safety, which " goes beyond the design and manufacture products always safer " and said it contributed to this objective by other actions to educational and informative.
The new campaign of encouragement of helmets in two wheels, under the motto " To be or not to be " will include a first phase during which the posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages of motorcycles, in order to ensure the wider dissemination.

The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing
After almost two years ago, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6 per cent in 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures of the employers ' association of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, the number of dealers.
It should, however, to the good news, since the reference for comparison, the month of November 2008, was particularly bad, with 60 per cent reduction compared with the previous year.
Consequently, despite the region last month, the accumulated registrations in those 11 months are 40 per cent below those of the previous year.
Since January, if we add all the vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles) derived from passenger cars, pickups, pick-up trucks, vans and lorries to lightweight chassis (95 853 have been sold.
The big clouds affecting the request were not provided. In fact, although they are also bought by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100 per cent of cases through an external financing.
For example, restrictions under the control of bank loans, other factors such as the rate of unemployment or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this situation and, unlike cars, aid to the purchase of the 2000E have little used.
In addition to individuals, independent and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicles under 3.5 tonnes with a level of Co2 which does not exceed the 160 grams per kilometer, may also benefit, but the number of spoke for itself.
yesterday, Ganvam, it reminded once again the need for the administration to attach particular attention to these vehicles and industrial vehicles) trucks and buses (.
The dealers provides a year 2010 similar to the outgoing one, for which it is a drop in sales of cars and 4x4s (of 19 per cent.
Aid for emergency braking is now compulsory
As with anti-lock brakes and ABS as this will take place with the stability control ESP, aid to the emergency brakes will be a compulsory element on the European cars.
They are already mandatory on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by the way action, it can also help prevent many rear shocks.
L’assistant in emergency braking is increasing the pressure on the brakes in emergency cases detected by the system through the kick given by the driver.
But it is always the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident did not support on the brake before the collision, and half of them had not taken advantage of strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
intervention to aid in revancha, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance of the car needs to stop.
According to a study of the EU, if all the cars were fitted with this type of things, up to 1,100 fatal accidents where pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularisation of so-called intelligent of emergency braking systems: it is a disaster on four with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera, detect obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it means increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it did not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device has maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimise the damage.
General Motors postpone until January plan for Opel
While the workers from Opel of Figueruelas) Zaragoza (have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors) GM (Europe, that production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week in April – probably the 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer has warned it will need more time to conclude the contingency plan, Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, each item of the plan has been approved in advance by the party.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be first submitted to workers and to the governments of the countries where the factories, be postponed until early 2010.
However, GM can a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is not surprising, that the Swedish Government has intensified the pressure on the US manufacturer to take a decision as quickly as possible.
GM is in contact with possible new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the Dutch manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, supported by the Group of the Russian Converg, took importance.
In cases where there would agree with any of them, GM may sell part of Saab in the Chinese Baic.
The decision to close Saab by the end of year if it is not sold.
The wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
In designing their last and precious jewel, engineers Porsche are parties to the Boxster S and managed to l’amincir nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1 275 pounds.
That has led to happen, first, the roof which has been replaced by a roof " manual, reducing 21, to use in aluminium, such as those of the GT3, 15 kilos, to remove the air conditioner, 13, to reduce the petrol tank of 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilograms of earned, of bacquets sport, still 12 kilos, and with tyres light of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they have renounced the audio system CDR-30, winning six kilograms and replaced the poignéesdes doors by the door handles in tissues, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model are also with the PDK box to double clutch, the test was done on a model to manual transmission of six speeds, mainly on the roads of secondary network of California, mountain regions, with sharp particularly tortuous.
His behaviour can be described as d’irréprochable.
The decrease of weight does not prevent the car rolling on the floor with aplomb.
On the contrary: it was time that we had not tested a model as small and light, at the same time, guarantees the security in the turns, including at high speed.
is a small athlete, capable d’échauffer its musclesà speed for the necessary time, until we ask them to sprint, slow to recover and to press for his moteur…
It is out what we wanted. Through its direction, communicative that said, the car will this qu’indiqueront our hands on the steering wheel.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Son of engine will
The son of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower) 10 more than the Boxster S (is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the “ sport ” or through a system that changes the rugissement engine already used on the Panamera.
The capacity up is brutal, either with the ruling or at tip.
The suspensions are strong, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The pavement that we have travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car was well managed the nests of chicken.
The electronic assistants were barely act of presence throughout the trip, while some disagreement we have found ice in the morning and gravel, later in the morning.
Ultimately, a car ultralégère, more entertaining to drive and is more than a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be put to the sale in February 2010, at a price of 70 831 euros.

Thank you very much
After days of roses since the spring, during which asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty there arises again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents take decisions on a future.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize the debt by buying direct asset and indirectly providing ample liquidity to rates close to zero, so that financial institutions are buying assets to mobilize.
central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have been almost finalized and, without calling into question their political 36-year-old maverick liquidity, are beginning to put a bit of sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with their award to a year next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain an economic recovery without heterodox and we are seeing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of scholarships and the obligations of companies increase again, although they remain distant levels paranormaux they have achieved at the start of the year.
States were forced to socialize the risk private and public debt is again affected.
There is a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been selected shelters by investors, thus increasing the differences between the countries of the euro zone and Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard& Poor'sa threatened a new downward revision of the characterization of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral hazard, trying again to provoke a case for lesresponsables of global economic policy that had stalled the destructive effects of the credit on the destruction of employment, whereas what should be done is announcing a new d’Action of pardons.
However, Dubai is like a tribal fight between the sheikhs to restore the power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that finds the pot in roses.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be completely irrational that Ecofin is Hungary a non compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member countries of the euro zone of not respecting its commitments.
What is logical, is that Ecofin has prompted the Greek Government to transparency and its citizens share the need of extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excesses in high positions, it would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, as our differences of public debt increase to the obligations of companies in Europe, nousn’avons not to worry.
If the European gaps were and that our continued to increase, it would then an idiosyncratic risk.
affair Standard& Poor's is an anecdote. When our indicators standby force most of the research services to anticipate their models and to revise upward its forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, returning to the charge with a Japanese model pourl’économie Spanish, it does not much hope for.
again, it did seem to be an excellent opportunity to buy assets Spanish, even if for now " caution is the mother of security ".

If this is not the case, the investment necessary would come not to 60 million but to 95,000.
, however, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investment should not be used to increase production capacity, but the distribution networks and the interconnections.
From 2020, the question is changing, and it will increase the power.
Her bet focuses both on the central gas to coal, with mechanisms of recovery of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
in this area, 18 000 MW is necessary, with other " energies of support ”.
Galán, who believes that the draft law sustainable economy that the government has just approved is in line with what is, did not want the royal decree aimed to encourage the use of coal, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there was a clear long-term " in this direction, despite the measures “ ad hoc ”, such as a qualified President d’Iberdrola.
Anyway, Galán believes that the investment decisions, although they are on the long term, should begin to be taken, because they are some time before reaching maturity, and a profitable stable framework is needed to address them.

New tools for expertise of cars
In these days of bad weather and accidents, the car garages are not the only winners.
Every day thousands of cars that have been a disaster are reduced to a garage, where an expert to evaluate the damage and the cost of repairs.
Each disaster is different, and the cost of parts and the time of labour can be a long and complex.
Calculate the the cost of compensation between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labour can take two or three hours.
In contrast, with the assistance of tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100 per cent of experts use such systems.
The providers of services and solutions for the assessment of claims and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, and then treat them and give them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, the North American Solera, is the leader; 80 per cent of the estimates are carried out with its products.

Moreover, the amount of data to be processed is constantly increasing, so that over the last five years, plus versions, alternatives and motors have been launched in 15 years.
When a new car lot on the market, these companies are at work.
It is a very hard work, because we must label each of the thousand pieces of the vehicle and include its price.
In addition, there is a graphic image " intelligent " of each model on which we can click on the various parts of the car.
If it is a model sold en masse, the work can be prepared in a week if the process is moving very quickly.
If there is a little car sold, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex provides comprehensive information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.

Audatex invested each year, 90 million to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million are registered, and the customers receive updates every two days.
The creation of this huge flows of information allows companies to provide various uses and to offer products.
most common application to the repair and maintenance, but in different countries, there are tools for the management of scrap parts or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company which has a guide that provides information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex suggests not in our country, but in the United States.
In view of products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it may provide for professionals in the sector.

Y include cars, motorcycles, light industrial vehicles and heavy.
In addition to the cost of parts, it takes into account the time of compensation valued by the manufacturer or the scale of paint.
The tool is buying itself in terms of use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, to the maximum ten times per month.
Then, each insurance company, which conducts thousands d’expertises, is negotiating prices with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow full identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it is out of the assembly, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on the glasses, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows d’enchérir vehicles declared wrecks.
His office of statistics is very useful in identifying trends, analysis géo-démographiques or know the current problems by marks or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how much of a brand models are gone in the garage for a breakdown or how many had suffered serious losses for a given period.
Motive Gt is the only Spanish company which is dedicated to the development of such tools.
It sells, among others, Gt estimate, which is also intended to experts and provides digital images, as well as access to parts, price and official time of the manufacturer.
Motive Gt is a group Einsa, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for claims, breakdowns or maintenance devoiture.

The operation has involved a cost of 59.5 million for 85% of the capital of the society, which could grow next year to 15 per cent.
The acquisition was to offer more value added services to its customers, with access to a huge international market.

Devis garage in four stages
With the Auda-Taller, the company Audatex guarantees that l’usager received a quotation in only four stages: to identify the vehicle, the play, create a estimates and the generate.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince the professionals who are older and, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 off-roaders etc. 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and a connection to the Internet.
Once the model to repair identified through its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question is can we select the necessary piece.
L’utilisateur can include variables such as the price of labour, or cuts, then it can print the estimates for the customer.
AudaTaller is not a tool in its assessment as AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the budget for the garage, does not include the time of labour.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is EUR 350 per year, which may be the subject of credit.
Currently, the company Audatex works for that these images are in three dimensions.
It is an innovation that mechanics are a very good eye, it will, for example, select a door and turn to see the face.
